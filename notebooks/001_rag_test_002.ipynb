The game runs well overall but can feel \"off\" despite a good average framerate.

      "The release version of God of War Ragnarok on PC has several notable issues that suggest it may not be fully ready to be played for everyone. Users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards are encountering a significant error that prevents them from launching the game, as it indicates insufficient VRAM despite the game running well on weaker integrated graphics. Additionally, some players are experiencing crashes approximately every two hours, which is concerning considering the specs are above the minimum requirements. While there are some players who have reported a smooth experience, the requirement for a PSN account for a single-player game and the crashes for others further imply that the game may not be polished and optimized for all users. Thus, while some can play without issues, the overall readiness of the release version is questionable due to these bugs and limitations.\n"
