While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator. That said, the story is engaging and the historical setting is captivating, especially for fans of Ancient Greece. If you have the patience for the grind, there's still fun to be had\n",

       "  'review': \"to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\",\n",

The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.\",\n",

I understand that some people are given the OPTION to sign in but for others ( like me) it\\'s a requirement. Why? When I launch the game it just says \"A PSN account is required to play.\" and then I can either sign in, or quit the game. WTF? I hated it when EA did it, I hated it when Microsoft did it. I EPSECIALLY hated it when Ubisoft did it (Seriously GFYS Ubisoft). And I hate it now with Playstation doing it. The difference is that God of War: Ragnarok has ZERO online features. I can somewhat understand for games that are multiplayer or have online features but a single player only game? That\\'s a hard no from me.\\n\\nEdit: To a few of the people who commented. Not everyone does copious amounts of research on every single requirement, recommended specs, and reads the TOS for every game they play. That\\'s a terrible argument and a completely unreasonable expectation. Stop making excuses for bad consumer practices. L corpo bootlicking.',\n",

      "{'appid': '2369390', 'review': 'As a long-time fan of the Far Cry series, I had high hopes for Far Cry 6, but unfortunately, it left me more frustrated than entertained. While the game had the potential to be another blockbuster in the series, it ultimately fails to live up to its predecessors in several key areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepetitive Gameplay:\\r\\nThe most glaring issue with Far Cry 6 is the repetitive nature of its gameplay. After the initial excitement of exploring a new open world and engaging in guerrilla warfare, the missions quickly become monotonous. The game essentially boils down to a rinse-and-repeat cycle of capturing outposts, destroying anti-aircraft sites, and completing fetch quests. There’s little innovation or variation in mission design, making the game feel like a chore rather than an adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwhelming Storyline:\\r\\nOne of the series’ strengths has always been its compelling villains, but Anton Castillo, portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito, is disappointingly underutilized. The story lacks depth and fails to engage on an emotional level. The protagonist, Dani Rojas, is also bland, with dialogue that feels forced and lacks the charisma needed to carry the narrative. The moral complexity that previous games offered is missing here, leaving a generic and predictable plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical Issues:\\r\\nFar Cry 6 is plagued by technical problems that severely hamper the experience. The game suffers from frequent bugs and glitches, including enemies that disappear, missions that don’t trigger properly, and frustratingly long load times. These issues break immersion and make the game feel unfinished. Even on higher-end systems, performance can be inconsistent, with frame drops and stuttering during intense sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nLack of Innovation:\\r\\nFor a game that is part of a well-established series, Far Cry 6 brings very little new to the table. The formula feels stale, and the game seems content to recycle elements from previous entries without adding anything truly fresh or exciting. The crafting system is cumbersome, and the inclusion of Resolver weapons, while initially intriguing, quickly loses its novelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTedious Collectibles and Side Content:\\r\\nThe game is bloated with unnecessary collectibles and side activities that feel like padding rather than meaningful content. Chasing after roosters, hunting mythical animals, or collecting USB sticks doesn’t add much to the overall experience and often feels like busywork. These side quests are neither engaging nor rewarding enough to justify the time spent on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion:\\r\\nFar Cry 6 is a disappointing entry in a franchise that once set the standard for open-world shooters. It struggles with repetitive gameplay, a lackluster story, and technical issues that detract from the overall experience. While it may offer some moments of fun, especially for newcomers to the series, it fails to capture the magic that made its predecessors so beloved. For long-time fans, this installment might feel more like a step backward than a step forward.'}\n",

So how could I know what to say?\"\\n\\nDustborn, to me, was less a game about different factions fighting for control in an alternate universe where people have superpowers that are neither fully understood nor seen as a good thing, not even by the people who have access to them. \\nIt certainly is that, too, but what really spoke to me was the feeling of accompanying these people on their journey of self-discovery, of trying to find personal meaning in an - at times - out of control situation. None of the characters in the game is in a particularly good spot when the game begins. That is understandable, even if it is unpleasant at times. \\nEven though they are friends, and in this mess of a situation together, they are very isolated and don\\'t necessarily know how to connect with each other. It was really rewarding to me to see them learn how to listen and empathise, even if they disagree. All of this happened slowly over the entire runtime (~20 hours) of the game, so it never felt aprupt or forced.\\n The conversation system and the other ways of interacting with the cast of characters really shone for me. \\nDustborn lets you play your main character with a wide range. Are you going to use your Vox powers at the first possible moment or are you trying to minimize its use? Are you going to only look out for yourself or make room for others needs?\\nAre you going to be abrasive in conversations or take the time to listen? \\nDepending of how you play your cards, situations will be different, and so will the relationships in the game - for better of for worse. \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and am looking forward to playing a second run after I\\'ve let the thoughts swirling around in my mind settle for a bit. \\n   \\n'}\n",

      "{'appid': '315210', 'review': 'Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is one of those games that, unfortunately, got swept into the vortex of modern gaming woes. Yes, it launched with bugs, and yes, the internet quickly latched onto those issues. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that bugs are a common, frustrating reality in gaming today. Many recent titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 or Fallout 76, were trainwrecks at launch but improved significantly with updates. Suicide Squad isn’t exempt from this unfortunate trend, but it also follows the pattern of getting better over time.\\n\\nIn terms of the superhero genre, the pickings are slim right now. With DC Universe Online effectively dead, City of Heroes clinging to life on private servers, and Champions Online practically irrelevant, Suicide Squad stands out as one of the few superhero multiplayer experiences we have left. And honestly? It’s fun. Is it repetitive at times? Yes. Is it terrible? No. There’s solid enjoyment to be had, even if the game could benefit from some fresh ideas, additional enemy types, and perhaps more variety in the factions—just like its Arkham predecessors.\\n\\nThe plot is another redeeming factor, especially for long-time DC fans. At first glance, the story seems straightforward, but as the narrative unfolds, it hints at a larger multiverse plot involving Brainiac’s invasion. Without spoiling too much, this twist injects excitement and speculation into the game, suggesting that maybe the Justice League you’re up against isn’t even from your universe. It’s a classic DC move, diving into the multiverse concept, and it opens up some intriguing possibilities for future DLCs.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that a small percentage of players have actually spent meaningful time with the game, as evidenced by achievement statistics on Steam. So, before writing it off based on early criticism, give it a try—you might enjoy it more than you think.\\n\\nI’ll admit, as a long-time DC fan, I was skeptical at first. The game didn’t truly click for me until the Flash boss battle. But from that point forward, it became fun and engaging, especially with the speculation around the plot.\\n\\nIn short, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is an enjoyable superhero romp. It may not revolutionize the genre, but it’s a solid experience with fun combat, well-written humor, and characters that feel true to their personalities. It’s not perfect, but it’s far from the disaster some are making it out to be. If you give it a fair shot, you might be surprised by how much fun you have.'}\n",

      "{'appid': '315210', 'review': 'It\\'s alright, don\\'t buy this for the full price tag though, I got the deluxe for 28 and still have the DLC else world stuff to explore and I\\'ve got almost 50 hours in. So I\\'d say its worth it, if you just wanted standard edition there is one that is 18 dollars on gg deals. Not a bad price considering how we should be getting the third season of content relatively soon, hoping its decent though since they just started doing lay offs at the company, so really its not the greatest game but not that bad either. Don\\'t come into this thinking its anything like Arkham knight or city / asylum. Its not, it uses the existing lore established from those games with some cool little easter eggs here and there plus riddler is in it, so ya know you got that mechanic returning lol. Overall though I was quite satisfied with the game although the end game definitely can get repetitive I did like the story parts and a few other things too. They did kill my boy Kevin but I do believe if the multiverse facet is a part of the endgame which it is, than flash could legit just flash point the arkham verse making the suicide squad from never happening. Shit they could make origins the new cannon which is seemingly what is happening with Arkham Shadows ? Not a bad idea at all since I liked origins for what it was. Good game overall 7/10 wish there was more end game content. Will change to 8/10 if they do successfully add in the last 13 Spoilers here - Brainiac\\'s into end game which is essentially another planet for you to kill brainiac on and add the true game ending if that\\'s even possible at this point.\\n\\nSIDE Note / EDIT: Really should be changing my review to a negative but I will keep it because I did enjoy the base game content. HUGE WARNING if you wanted to experience the Joker World and Also Mr\\'s Freeze episodes in order you are simply fucked or screwed over since I can\\'t curse. It is simply impossible to go back to episode one after beating the game. It force jumps you alllll the way to episode 4. So Brainiac is talking about how Mrs Freeze helped rescue the ----Big Spoiler---- but not like it matters since you cant go back and enjoy everything for yourself. The Flash. How the fuck did that happen how did we find another flash let alone is he infected or is he normal? You don\\'t know because you can\\'t properly experience the story yourself. I was seriously blown away by this design choice/decision, huge letdown to not simply let you load into the Elseworlds that you want to load into like the Joker World that looks different from the base game metropolis. First, the water is changed, the sky box is changed, the textures and buildings are changed, and new exterior buildings are added in the Joker world! All of this content is now locked away forever! Oh but don\\'t worry episode 4 you get a couple of really \"cool\" ice Spikes. Thats it.... No new buildings, skybox, water color, Christ it doesn\\'t even fucking snow at the very least. You\\'d think if you\\'re adding in Mr Freeze (Mrs.Freeze) You\\'d at least have a snowing weather type to make it feel colder since you know he needs cold to stay alive. However though I guess the team got fired well into making season 2 of Mrs.Freeze because man, what a letdown in both terms of character and Map, the map is not different at all no one can convince me it is, they only changed the areas that brainiac spawns things in hence the giant ice spike in the ground, not cool or interesting at all like Jokers Worlds was. Will be waiting patiently to see if Rocksteady jumped ahead of this garbage season and added cool things to Season 3\\'s Gotham-themed Metropolis. It is the only explanation as to why this season is so fucking empty and lifeless. compared to season 1 which wasn\\'t great either but in terms of the Map yeah, it was 10 times better.'}\n",

      "{'appid': '315210', 'review': 'For a start, I\\'d say the game is genuinely fun, with unique mechanics and styles to each squad member. The feedback regarding the use of guns tend to be silly, since a melee build is still highly plausible to play around should you choose to make use of it. I may not agree that they should\\'ve gone that route, but it\\'s still entertaining to play with. If you\\'re a fan of the suicide squad characters and comics in general, the game is enjoyable and you\\'re likely to have a good time just watching the characters and squad dynamics throughout the main campaign and the occasional banter / commentary in the overworld. The audio file collectibles can be tedious however, tho it\\'s similar enough to collecting Riddler trophies in the arkham games that you don\\'t think too much about it and just do it. \\n\\nThe main thing that bogs it down is its repetitive live-service elements. The story is taking an interesting direction in the latest episode (as of this review it\\'s ep4), and I feel like the game genuinely would\\'ve fared better if they just gave us a proper solo story campaign from the get-go - with the inclusion of where the story seems to be heading. The campaign we were given at launch ends with pretty much a \"huh? that\\'ts it?\" beat. The potential is there, but the chopping up of story acts to drop during live-service episodes just hurts the interest in the game, esp when the live-service elements are repetitive incursion missions that don\\'t retain much interest from fans who don\\'t care for more guns. The Arkham games were spectacular and replayable because the story and beats were packaged so neatly, I just wish Rocksteady and WB games did the same for this. \\n\\nAll in all I personally still play the game because I still hope to see where the story leads (that IS the main appeal to me), and as a Suicide Squad fan myself I just enjoy getting to see the squad in a game. It\\'s a shame that higher ups chose to make this a live-service, as I\\'m almost certain the negative feedback wouldn\\'t be as severe if it was a solid story-driven campaign. Love the characters, enjoy the potential, don\\'t enjoy the repetitiveness and waits for live-service updates for story. Will still recommend the game, but not at the price it\\'s at.

Imagine trying to juggle three flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Blindfolded. That\\'s about as intuitive as it gets. Who needs balance or skill when you can just get obliterated by a Viking with the hand-eye coordination of a potato?\\n\\nAnd let’s talk about the online experience, which is basically a 50/50 gamble on whether you’ll be matched with an opponent or just a loading screen that lasts longer than your will to live. But when you do finally get into a game, you\\'re welcomed by the soothing sounds of your teammates hurling insults at each other because, let’s be real, that’s the true \"community spirit\" here.\\n\\nThe story mode? I didn’t even know it had one until I accidentally clicked on it, and I wish I hadn’t. It’s like a rejected script for a knockoff Game of Thrones fanfiction, but with less coherence and more facepalming.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re a masochist who loves the sensation of repeatedly slamming your head into a brick wall while listening to prepubescent kids yell obscenities, For Honor is the game for you.

      "{'appid': '2208920', 'review': \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the twelfth main installment in Ubisoft’s renowned Assassin's Creed series. Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game’s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor’s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game’s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\\n\\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England—from the rolling hills of England’s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor’s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game’s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game’s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\n\\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware. However, Ubisoft has released several patches to address these concerns and improve the game’s stability.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is a monumental addition to the series, offering a captivating Viking adventure that blends historical intrigue with mythological elements. Its expansive open world, engaging combat, and deep RPG mechanics provide a robust and immersive experience. Despite some technical issues and a less pronounced focus on stealth, the game’s strengths make it a worthy journey for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Assassin’s Creed franchise. For those intrigued by Norse mythology, medieval history, and expansive RPGs, Valhalla delivers an epic and satisfying experience that stands out as one of the series' most ambitious entries.\\n\\n\"}\n",

Another stark difference of Valhalla is the divorce between the traditional combat and stealth we've always known. No longer are the days where stealth is a requirement for an Assassin's Creed game. Now, you are a brute of a viking with a big, heavy ax, and subtlety is not exactly your strong suit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese two major changes were enough to scare off many AC traditionalist, but to put it frankly?

There can be no doubt that Concord has really clicked for a dozen of players, which you will find out, when your entire team of level 2 accounts blindly rushes into the open, to get absolutely destroyed in seconds. I suppose the only upside of the long queue times, is that by the time people actually get into a game, the Steam refund window will be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany reviewers have already commented on the bland character designs, which is very disappointing considering the rich worldbuilding, gorgeous environments and Bungie skyboxes. I am willing to bet my Canadian pesos that if you show a random person a picture of Teo, they would be hard pressed to tell you which game he's from. The character design is not just a failure in an aesthetic sense: given that many of the crucial roles are so visually unappealing, in random games (the only ones you can currently play due to the aforementioned lack of players) everyone will lock down the same 4 or 5 characters, which results in poor team compositions. Now I am not saying that every game needs anime waifus, but it is very important to make support and tank characters visually appealing, so that people would want to pick them. Meanwhile, players will be wondering how the hell Daw passed military qualification, lock down Star Child, and then rush into a chokepoint to get instantly obliterated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a $40 game, the customisation is simply not there. Each character will have 5-6 recolours, and a low-effort legendary skin that will often be somehow worse than the default outfit. For a game with such high production values, it is puzzling that the developers have spent no effort on making cosmetics unlocks visually-appealing. By comparison, if you were to spend that money on a couple of season passes for the Free-to-Play games Concord is attempting to compete with, you will end up with a bunch of outrageous, distinct outfits that probably play the sad whale song each time you score a kill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Concord, you can unlock variants of the 16 classes through five sets of objectives, with some variants being significantly stronger than the starting loadouts. I am definitely not a fan of this system, and it feels like a cheap way to add unlockables instead of designing a comprehensive loadout system: some guns just don't feel great, and it would be great to have some gear customisation options, instead of avoiding a character because their one weapon sucks. Yes, I get the game balance angle, but surely Concord have enough combined experience making PVP games to balance about 18 different guns!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gunplay is mostly satisfying, some maps are quite good, and there is a lot of good game design, which makes Concord encounters interesting and enjoyable. Nonetheless, with all these issues, I just can't recommend the game and, by the time you read this review, the game will simply not have enough players to be worth saving. Also, and this can't be stressed enough, this game took 8 years to make. WHY??\"}\n",

After investing over 370 hours, I can confidently say that it’s been one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had in my +16 years of gaming!\\n\\nAs someone who’s relatively new to games like Baldur\\'s Gate 3, The game has done wonders in introducing me to the complexities of D&D within a digital realm. The adaptation of traditional tabletop mechanics into a seamless and engaging gameplay experience is nothing short of remarkableness.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, the world of Faerûn feels alive and immersive, thanks to the stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The narrative is very engaging and full of twists, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful. The voice acting and character interactions are absolutely top-notch! Bringing the story and its inhabitants to life in a way that’s truly memorable.\\n\\nWhat really sets Baldur’s Gate 3 apart is its depth. With hundreds of quests, countless choices, and a variety of playstyles, there’s always something new to discover. The replayability is off the charts! Each playthrough can be a completely different experience! The flexibility in character creation and party dynamics allows you to craft a unique adventure every time.\\n\\nIf you’re a fan of RPGs in general or just looking for a game that offers a rich, engaging experience, Baldur’s Gate 3 is more than worth your time. My 370+ hours are a testament to its insane quality and replayability. This game has completely set a new standard for the genre! And I highly recommend it to anyone!\\n\\nThat said, if there is one \"downside\" that I could possible think of that is worth mentioning about Baldur\\'s Gate 3, It has to be the fact that it may not be the most welcoming for players who are completely new to the D&D aspect of the game [u] (Like me!) [/u] . The depth and complexity of the D&D mechanics can be daunting quite a bit at first, and it takes some time to fully grasp the nuances if you’re unfamiliar with the system. However, this challenge is also a blessing in disguise. It pushes you to learn and appreciate the intricacies of D&D, enriching your overall experience and deepening your understanding of the game’s mechanics. If you’re like me and are very excited to dive into the beauty of RPG with a truly remarkable blend with D&D, The feeling of immersion is something to totally embrace! \\n\\n[h3] ALSO! [/h3]\\n\\nI’m incredibly excited to see what Patch 7 has in store and how it will further enhance this already amazing game! A huge shoutout to Larian Studios and everyone who worked on this project. Your dedication and passion have created an absolute masterpiece and This game is a testament to your incredible talent and hard work, and I’m grateful for the unforgettable adventure you’ve given us all! \\n\\n[b] From the bottom of my heart. Thank you SO SO much! ♡ [/b]\\n'}\n",

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws.

A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish.

This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions. They aren't bad by any stretch just boring compared to the normal gameplay. One minute you're zipping across sky scrapers and the next you're forced into a stealth section as a normie. There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot.

I thought that swinging around the map and completing all of the map markers, objectives, etc was engaging and didn\\'t feel too repetitive OUTSIDE OF the stupid Screwball challenges. I hated those so much more than I can properly express. They were one of the last achievements I got because I just kept putting them off. You feel like Spider-Man while you\\'re playing this, quips and all, albeit with maybe a bit more tech than I usually would expect out of him. You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game. I fully recommend this game at full price or on sale as I think it\\'s got more than enough content to be worth it.'}]\n"

      "Are there excessive cutscenes in Far Cry 6 that interrupt the gameplay experience?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"This is a GREAT super hero game.  I am at 6hrs as of writing this and I'm loving every minute.  Graphics are very good, the voice acting is superb, and the story is engrossing.  Gameplay is tight, fun, and varied.  Nothing really beats just swinging around NYC at the end of the day.  It's so smooth and you can feel the weight and the speed.  It's not perfect as there are some little nuisances here and there, but it's as close to perfect as it gets.  9/10  You really ARE Spidey in this.\"}]\n"

For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance.

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable.

      "What were the standout features mentioned in the review regarding the game's story and mechanics?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'One of the best mechanics in a game really well optimised and the story is really good would recommend'}]\n"

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience.

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws.

A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

I cannot overstate enough how much fun it is to just swing around the city and save people. The story was quite good and integrated Spider-Man villains in a engaging way. I liked that you got to fight some big villains and the classic \"hey give me your money\" muggers. The DLC was integrated in this remastered PC version of the game and was also quite enjoyable as I do love Black Cat (who doesn\\'t???). I thought that swinging around the map and completing all of the map markers, objectives, etc was engaging and didn\\'t feel too repetitive OUTSIDE OF the stupid Screwball challenges. I hated those so much more than I can properly express. They were one of the last achievements I got because I just kept putting them off. You feel like Spider-Man while you\\'re playing this, quips and all, albeit with maybe a bit more tech than I usually would expect out of him. You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game. I fully recommend this game at full price or on sale as I think it\\'s got more than enough content to be worth it.'}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"One of the best games I played on the steam deck really shows the steam decks capability's.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"This Game was a fun and a very enjoyable playable experience. The story had good pace throughout the game {got better further on} \\nSwinging through the city is just very fun and just never boring.\\nUnlocking different gadgets, suits and extra powers just betters the experience\\nThe extra Free DLC's make the game just MAKE the game Better!\\nOnly few downsides are, not that cheap and movement is slighly annyoing at times.\\nThe game does very good to lead on the next game {miles morales} \\n8/10\\n\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time.

It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Very good story, almost great (though the Sabre act feels like padding and fighting their troops is annoying), fantastic game feel and the best web swinging since Spider-Man 2 on the PS2.  Feels like a nice evolution of Arkham\\'s Freeflow combat system while also carving out its own identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Arkham series though it really makes you want to drop the cliche \"really makes you feel like Spider-Man\".  Kinda does though.'}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game.

      "What is the game's performance on high-end hardware like the RTX 4070?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'I love it, the game runs great with my RTX 4060, the story is amazing, one of the best video games of spider man.'}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance.

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "Is Baldur's Gate 3 going to offer a quality experience at launch without bugs or issues?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion.

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments.

Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming.

The main story was well written and all the cut-scenes, side quests, villians, and DLCs were worth the money. The fighting is exactly how I would picture it would look if Spider-Man was real and BIG PLUS to having the Tobey Maguire suit available to be played as cause hes the best, no contest.\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"In principle, the game is good, BUT:\\nIf you are a fan of Spider-Man, then you will 100% like the game, if not, then the game has some disadvantages. Firstly, the game has very rebatative activities in the open world, in other words, a lot of single marks on the map (at first it's cool, but there are too many of them, and by the end it gets really boring). Secondly, the plot is a typical superhero plot (only morons won't be irritated by its stupidity). And the last significant disadvantage is that the dynamic gameplay for Spider-Man is diluted with dull quests for Mary Jane and Miles Morales.\\nOf course, the game has many advantages, because of which I recommend this game: very pleasant combat (dynamic, beautiful, exciting), although by the last chapter it got boring. Another huge advantage is the open world, in the sense that it is very beautiful. Overall, the game is really interesting to play, everything is beautiful and interesting, with the exception of a few of the above-described downsides.\"}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in. You can unlock all kinds of spider suits that are new to the franchise and legacy outfits from the comics and television adaptations. This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions. They aren't bad by any stretch just boring compared to the normal gameplay. One minute you're zipping across sky scrapers and the next you're forced into a stealth section as a normie. There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot. If you're the person that doesn't care for Marvel but you do enjoy stealth, movement mechanics and beat em up style games you will also probably enjoy this.... If you are J.

Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"If you've never played this game before I highly recommend giving it a shot. The story is pretty good! Easy to digest and appreciate. The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in.

This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions.

There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "What themes are explored in Neo Cab through its narrative and character interactions?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'This game was unbelievably great.\\n\\nThe movement, the fighting, the movement, the perfect difficulty, the movement, the enemies all having character and are not just being plain evil, the movement, the stories were aresome, and also, almost forgot to mention this, the movement.\\n\\n10/10. What a fucking game.'}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.

Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance.

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable.

They give you something to do in the world which is nice (swinging around the city is easily the highlight of this game).

The story is pretty good! Easy to digest and appreciate. The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in. You can unlock all kinds of spider suits that are new to the franchise and legacy outfits from the comics and television adaptations. This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions. They aren't bad by any stretch just boring compared to the normal gameplay. One minute you're zipping across sky scrapers and the next you're forced into a stealth section as a normie. There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot. If you're the person that doesn't care for Marvel but you do enjoy stealth, movement mechanics and beat em up style games you will also probably enjoy this.... If you are J.

I cannot overstate enough how much fun it is to just swing around the city and save people. The story was quite good and integrated Spider-Man villains in a engaging way. I liked that you got to fight some big villains and the classic \"hey give me your money\" muggers. The DLC was integrated in this remastered PC version of the game and was also quite enjoyable as I do love Black Cat (who doesn\\'t???). I thought that swinging around the map and completing all of the map markers, objectives, etc was engaging and didn\\'t feel too repetitive OUTSIDE OF the stupid Screwball challenges. I hated those so much more than I can properly express. They were one of the last achievements I got because I just kept putting them off. You feel like Spider-Man while you\\'re playing this, quips and all, albeit with maybe a bit more tech than I usually would expect out of him. You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game. I fully recommend this game at full price or on sale as I think it\\'s got more than enough content to be worth it.'}]\n"

      "Are there excessive cutscenes in Far Cry 6 that interrupt the gameplay experience?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"This is a GREAT super hero game.  I am at 6hrs as of writing this and I'm loving every minute.  Graphics are very good, the voice acting is superb, and the story is engrossing.  Gameplay is tight, fun, and varied.  Nothing really beats just swinging around NYC at the end of the day.  It's so smooth and you can feel the weight and the speed.  It's not perfect as there are some little nuisances here and there, but it's as close to perfect as it gets.  9/10  You really ARE Spidey in this.\"}]\n"

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable.

      "What were the standout features mentioned in the review regarding the game's story and mechanics?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'One of the best mechanics in a game really well optimised and the story is really good would recommend'}]\n"

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

I cannot overstate enough how much fun it is to just swing around the city and save people. The story was quite good and integrated Spider-Man villains in a engaging way. I liked that you got to fight some big villains and the classic \"hey give me your money\" muggers. The DLC was integrated in this remastered PC version of the game and was also quite enjoyable as I do love Black Cat (who doesn\\'t???). I thought that swinging around the map and completing all of the map markers, objectives, etc was engaging and didn\\'t feel too repetitive OUTSIDE OF the stupid Screwball challenges. I hated those so much more than I can properly express. They were one of the last achievements I got because I just kept putting them off. You feel like Spider-Man while you\\'re playing this, quips and all, albeit with maybe a bit more tech than I usually would expect out of him. You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game. I fully recommend this game at full price or on sale as I think it\\'s got more than enough content to be worth it.'}]\n"

      "Can I expect a seamless gaming experience with Dustborn on Steam without needing additional applications?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"One of the best games I played on the steam deck really shows the steam decks capability's.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

The story had good pace throughout the game {got better further on} \\nSwinging through the city is just very fun and just never boring.\\nUnlocking different gadgets, suits and extra powers just betters the experience\\nThe extra Free DLC's make the game just MAKE the game Better!\\nOnly few downsides are, not that cheap and movement is slighly annyoing at times.\\nThe game does very good to lead on the next game {miles morales} \\n8/10\\n\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Very good story, almost great (though the Sabre act feels like padding and fighting their troops is annoying), fantastic game feel and the best web swinging since Spider-Man 2 on the PS2.  Feels like a nice evolution of Arkham\\'s Freeflow combat system while also carving out its own identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Arkham series though it really makes you want to drop the cliche \"really makes you feel like Spider-Man\".  Kinda does though.'}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}]\n"

You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities.

      "What is the game's performance on high-end hardware like the RTX 4070?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'I love it, the game runs great with my RTX 4060, the story is amazing, one of the best video games of spider man.'}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero.

If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance.

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers.

There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better.

It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man.

The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments.

The main story was well written and all the cut-scenes, side quests, villians, and DLCs were worth the money. The fighting is exactly how I would picture it would look if Spider-Man was real and BIG PLUS to having the Tobey Maguire suit available to be played as cause hes the best, no contest.\"}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"In principle, the game is good, BUT:\\nIf you are a fan of Spider-Man, then you will 100% like the game, if not, then the game has some disadvantages. Firstly, the game has very rebatative activities in the open world, in other words, a lot of single marks on the map (at first it's cool, but there are too many of them, and by the end it gets really boring). Secondly, the plot is a typical superhero plot (only morons won't be irritated by its stupidity). And the last significant disadvantage is that the dynamic gameplay for Spider-Man is diluted with dull quests for Mary Jane and Miles Morales.\\nOf course, the game has many advantages, because of which I recommend this game: very pleasant combat (dynamic, beautiful, exciting), although by the last chapter it got boring. Another huge advantage is the open world, in the sense that it is very beautiful. Overall, the game is really interesting to play, everything is beautiful and interesting, with the exception of a few of the above-described downsides.\"}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish.

The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in. You can unlock all kinds of spider suits that are new to the franchise and legacy outfits from the comics and television adaptations. This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions. They aren't bad by any stretch just boring compared to the normal gameplay. One minute you're zipping across sky scrapers and the next you're forced into a stealth section as a normie. There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot. If you're the person that doesn't care for Marvel but you do enjoy stealth, movement mechanics and beat em up style games you will also probably enjoy this.... If you are J.

The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"If you've never played this game before I highly recommend giving it a shot. The story is pretty good! Easy to digest and appreciate. The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in. You can unlock all kinds of spider suits that are new to the franchise and legacy outfits from the comics and television adaptations. This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions.

There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot.

The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

      "What themes are explored in Neo Cab through its narrative and character interactions?\n",
      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'Overall: 8.75/10\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:('}, {'appid': '1817070', 'review': 'This game was unbelievably great.\\n\\nThe movement, the fighting, the movement, the perfect difficulty, the movement, the enemies all having character and are not just being plain evil, the movement, the stories were aresome, and also, almost forgot to mention this, the movement.\\n\\n10/10.

      "[{'appid': '1817070', 'review': \"Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you’re content with the original and aren’t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available.
