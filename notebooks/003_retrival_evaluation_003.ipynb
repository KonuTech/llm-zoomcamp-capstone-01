While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator. That said, the story is engaging and the historical setting is captivating, especially for fans of Ancient Greece. If you have the patience for the grind, there's still fun to be had\n",

       "  'review': \"to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\",\n",

The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.\",\n",

I understand that some people are given the OPTION to sign in but for others ( like me) it\\'s a requirement. Why? When I launch the game it just says \"A PSN account is required to play.\" and then I can either sign in, or quit the game. WTF? I hated it when EA did it, I hated it when Microsoft did it. I EPSECIALLY hated it when Ubisoft did it (Seriously GFYS Ubisoft). And I hate it now with Playstation doing it. The difference is that God of War: Ragnarok has ZERO online features. I can somewhat understand for games that are multiplayer or have online features but a single player only game? That\\'s a hard no from me.\\n\\nEdit: To a few of the people who commented. Not everyone does copious amounts of research on every single requirement, recommended specs, and reads the TOS for every game they play. That\\'s a terrible argument and a completely unreasonable expectation. Stop making excuses for bad consumer practices. L corpo bootlicking.',\n",

      "{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}\n",

      "{'appid': '2369390', 'review': 'As a long-time fan of the Far Cry series, I had high hopes for Far Cry 6, but unfortunately, it left me more frustrated than entertained. While the game had the potential to be another blockbuster in the series, it ultimately fails to live up to its predecessors in several key areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepetitive Gameplay:\\r\\nThe most glaring issue with Far Cry 6 is the repetitive nature of its gameplay. After the initial excitement of exploring a new open world and engaging in guerrilla warfare, the missions quickly become monotonous. The game essentially boils down to a rinse-and-repeat cycle of capturing outposts, destroying anti-aircraft sites, and completing fetch quests. There’s little innovation or variation in mission design, making the game feel like a chore rather than an adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwhelming Storyline:\\r\\nOne of the series’ strengths has always been its compelling villains, but Anton Castillo, portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito, is disappointingly underutilized. The story lacks depth and fails to engage on an emotional level. The protagonist, Dani Rojas, is also bland, with dialogue that feels forced and lacks the charisma needed to carry the narrative. The moral complexity that previous games offered is missing here, leaving a generic and predictable plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical Issues:\\r\\nFar Cry 6 is plagued by technical problems that severely hamper the experience. The game suffers from frequent bugs and glitches, including enemies that disappear, missions that don’t trigger properly, and frustratingly long load times. These issues break immersion and make the game feel unfinished. Even on higher-end systems, performance can be inconsistent, with frame drops and stuttering during intense sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nLack of Innovation:\\r\\nFor a game that is part of a well-established series, Far Cry 6 brings very little new to the table. The formula feels stale, and the game seems content to recycle elements from previous entries without adding anything truly fresh or exciting. The crafting system is cumbersome, and the inclusion of Resolver weapons, while initially intriguing, quickly loses its novelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTedious Collectibles and Side Content:\\r\\nThe game is bloated with unnecessary collectibles and side activities that feel like padding rather than meaningful content. Chasing after roosters, hunting mythical animals, or collecting USB sticks doesn’t add much to the overall experience and often feels like busywork. These side quests are neither engaging nor rewarding enough to justify the time spent on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion:\\r\\nFar Cry 6 is a disappointing entry in a franchise that once set the standard for open-world shooters. It struggles with repetitive gameplay, a lackluster story, and technical issues that detract from the overall experience. While it may offer some moments of fun, especially for newcomers to the series, it fails to capture the magic that made its predecessors so beloved.

None of the characters in the game is in a particularly good spot when the game begins. That is understandable, even if it is unpleasant at times. \\nEven though they are friends, and in this mess of a situation together, they are very isolated and don\\'t necessarily know how to connect with each other. It was really rewarding to me to see them learn how to listen and empathise, even if they disagree. All of this happened slowly over the entire runtime (~20 hours) of the game, so it never felt aprupt or forced.\\n The conversation system and the other ways of interacting with the cast of characters really shone for me. \\nDustborn lets you play your main character with a wide range. Are you going to use your Vox powers at the first possible moment or are you trying to minimize its use? Are you going to only look out for yourself or make room for others needs?\\nAre you going to be abrasive in conversations or take the time to listen? \\nDepending of how you play your cards, situations will be different, and so will the relationships in the game - for better of for worse. \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and am looking forward to playing a second run after I\\'ve let the thoughts swirling around in my mind settle for a bit. \\n   \\n'}\n",

You also influence the characters with your decisions, even being able to push the initial cast of characters towards three different directions (like buddy, dad, and boss in Theo's case).\\r\\nThe dialogue is very slice of life style a lot of time, having the characters talk about whatever topics that come up or situation they find themself in, while also sharing stuff about their privat life. I enjoyed listening to the banter between the characters, finding their jokes and comments regularly amusing.\\r\\nThe story of the game feels slow, putting the focus more on the roadtrip with friend aspect, but it has its moment.

At first, I was hesitant to try it out because of the overwhelming negative reviews I’d seen, but I didn’t want anyone else to miss out on something amazing due to that, so here I am sharing my honest experience.\\n\\nAs a huge fan of the Arkham Batman series (they were masterpieces to me in my teenage years, a perfect blend of art and gameplay), it was tough to come to terms with what happens to Batman in this game. But at the same time, it’s fascinating to see how our beloved heroes could be portrayed in their darkest moments.\\n\\nFor me, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League feels like a fresh breath of air, especially after Gotham Knights. It's incredibly exciting to step into the shoes of Deadshot and other antiheroes and villains. The gameplay mission with Mrs. Freeze from Season 2 that I watched blew my mind—it’s absolutely stunning!\\n\\nBut on the other hand, the game suffers from poor optimization and performance issues, especially on lower-end devices like the Steam Deck. This really hampers the gaming experience, making it difficult to fully enjoy the game. I hope Rocksteady can address these issues in future patches, as it’s a shame that such a great game is held back by technical problems.\\n\\nRight now, I’m thoroughly enjoying the storyline, which is genuinely engaging, and I can’t wait for new seasons and characters!

For starters: I bought that game on an 80% discount (19,99€). I dont even know where to start. Lets start with the combat.

      "{'appid': '2239550', 'review': \"Watch Dogs Legion is an interesting insight into a dystopian city that has fallen down the rabbit hole and nobody seems to find a way out. First of all, the innovative (albeit a bit flawed) Play As Anyone mechanic introduced in the video game allows players to recruit virtually any non-playable character in the open world, each bringing unique skills, backgrounds, and personalities to the fight against oppression. The roleplaying implications are vast, as you can immerse yourself in the lives of everyday Londoners, from construction workers and cryptocurrency analysts to paramedics and pickpockets, shifting your playstyle with each character. This mechanic encourages creative approaches to missions (in the simplest possible ways if you so desire) and fosters a deep connection to the individuals you recruit, making the rebellion against authoritarianism feel truly communal and diverse.\\n\\nThe factions in Watch Dogs Legion paint a vivid picture of the powers at play in dystopian London. DedSec, the group you belong to, is a grassroots resistance trying to free the city from the grip of oppressive organizations. Albion, a private military contractor, enforces martial law, symbolizing the rise of corporate-controlled security forces. Clan Kelley operates in the shadows, profiting off of London's underworld through human trafficking and black market deals. Meanwhile, the Signals Intelligence Response Service (SIRS), the intelligence agency, wields control over mass surveillance, presenting a chilling representation of how governments can abuse technology for control. Each faction not only serves as a formidable antagonist but also represents a different aspect of totalitarian rule, from corporate to criminal to governmental.\\n\\nSkye Larsen's story arc encapsulates the game's exploration of transhumanism, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. As the visionary behind advanced artificial intelligence and the leader of Project Daybreak (a project that aims to upload human consciousness into machines), Skye Larsen's ambitions raise ethical questions about identity, mortality, and the price of immortality. Her storyline serves as the darkest example of how technology in the wrong hands can dehumanize and exploit life itself. Skye Larsen's character and her experiments on her own family force players to confront the ethical nightmare of playing God, making her one of the most disturbing and tragic figures in Watch Dogs Legion.\\n\\nLondon, as reimagined in Watch Dogs Legion, is a masterclass in world-building, capturing the essence of the city while painting it in a dystopian light. Iconic landmarks such as the Tower of London, Camden Market, and Westminster Abbey are seamlessly integrated into a future where drones, surveillance cameras, and propaganda posters are omnipresent. The streets feel alive with the tension of a city under siege, from graffiti depicting resistance movements and Albion Contractors arresting innocent civilians in the streets after an identity check to automated checkpoints manned by Albion drones and Clan Kelley Associates harassing citizens to enforce their authority in controlled territories. This version of London feels both familiar and unsettling, a city at once modern and trapped under the weight of technological authoritarianism.\\n\\nThe documents scattered throughout the video game's open world and various missions enrich the narrative, giving players deeper insight into the lives of both the oppressors and the oppressed. Audio logs, text files, relics and dialogues reveal the motivations behind the factions, the corruption within the system, and the personal stories of those suffering under Albion and Clan Kelley's rule. These collectibles add layers to the main plot, providing context to major events and fleshing out characters who might otherwise seem one-dimensional or who don't even appear in the video game but played a crucial role in illustrating the violence in a dangerous dystopian London. Collecting these pieces of hidden lore rewards players with a fuller understanding of the world and the true stakes of DedSec's fight for freedom.\\n\\nWatch Dogs Legion, as a narrative video game (if you have this approach in mind when playing it), is a powerful reminder that in the face of overwhelming oppression, it is not just heroes who rise up, but everyday people who are united in the belief that together, they can reclaim their future.\"}\n",

Ubisoft has turned what could have been a great Viking adventure into a drawn-out, bloated, and lifeless experience.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the length of the game is absolutely unnecessary. Ubisoft has padded the game with an endless list of fetch quests, useless side missions, and tedious grinding that doesn't feel rewarding.

I’m all for open-world exploration, but when 80% of the game feels like busywork, it’s a problem.\\n\\nAnd then there's the story—or lack thereof. Valhalla arguably has the worst story in the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise. The narrative is disjointed, dull, and lacks any emotional depth. Eivor is a bland protagonist, and the Viking setting, which had so much potential, is squandered by uninspired writing. There’s none of the intrigue or historical depth that made previous titles great. It feels like the Assassin’s Creed identity has been lost in favor of trying to be a generic RPG.\\n\\nTo top it off, Ubisoft’s downward trend continues. Year after year, they seem to care less about delivering quality and more about milking the franchise with microtransactions, repetitive content, and lifeless worlds. Valhalla is the perfect example of a game that prioritizes quantity over quality, and it shows.\\n\\nIn the end, I regret buying this game, and I can only hope Ubisoft listens to its fans before it’s too late.

      "{'appid': '2208920', 'review': \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the twelfth main installment in Ubisoft’s renowned Assassin's Creed series. Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game’s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor’s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game’s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\\n\\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England—from the rolling hills of England’s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor’s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game’s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game’s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\n\\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware. However, Ubisoft has released several patches to address these concerns and improve the game’s stability.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is a monumental addition to the series, offering a captivating Viking adventure that blends historical intrigue with mythological elements. Its expansive open world, engaging combat, and deep RPG mechanics provide a robust and immersive experience. Despite some technical issues and a less pronounced focus on stealth, the game’s strengths make it a worthy journey for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Assassin’s Creed franchise. For those intrigued by Norse mythology, medieval history, and expansive RPGs, Valhalla delivers an epic and satisfying experience that stands out as one of the series' most ambitious entries.\\n\\n\"}\n",

The time-to-kill ratio is VERY fast. For it to be this fast in a hero shooter, there *has* to be some modicum of health regen! Health pickups throughout maps are few and far between. Class-based systems are not emphasized ('Oh, big guy? Must be a tank. Oh, little guy with assault rifle? Must be a DPS...Wait, healer? healer?') You're kind of just left guessing about what to even do or how to strategize (Ironically, the game's training mode is quite enjoyable).\\n\\nIt's 2 core game modes to boot are a standard TDM and Area Control, which is basically Domination? Not bad game modes per se, just not something you would expect from this kind of game. This is something you see in a game like Rogue Company from Hi-Rez, which is completely free to play (and this is a $40-$60 title).\\n\\nIt's a shame because this game's design is fairly charming, almost feels like a Guardians of the Galaxy meets Overwatch type of hero shooter, but....it's riddled with technical issues that keep it from reaching its full potential.\\n\\nMaybe they'll turn it around? idk, but where it currently sits from a developmental standpoint, it seems like its A LOT to ask for. Feels like I played a really early access title.\"}\n",

      "{'appid': '1086940', 'review': \"[h2]A Delicate Dance Between Story and Sandbox[/h2]\\n\\nI just finished the first half of Act 1, and what impresses me most about [i]Baldur’s Gate III[/i] is its masterful balance between a structured narrative adventure and a sandbox full of creative possibilities.\\n\\nOn one hand, the game presents itself as a polished AAA experience: fully-voiced cinematic cutscenes at nearly every turn, an overwhelming amount of items to collect and interact with, and despite the ever-present danger in the world, there’s no real passage of in-game time, meaning no sense of urgency is forced upon you. You can explore at your own pace.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the game features a sophisticated simulation of physics that allows for emergent gameplay. Characters and items can catch fire, freeze, get soaked in water or acid, and more. Fire spreads, water douses it, conducts lightning, and can even be frozen. Nearly every object in the world can be moved or manipulated, and there’s an impressive range of player abilities that encourage experimentation. These systems lead to creative solutions for combat, exploration, and beyond, allowing for moments that feel entirely unscripted.\\n\\nWhat’s fascinating is how these two elements—the tightly scripted, cinematic storytelling and the open-ended, sandbox mechanics—seem almost at odds, yet they work in perfect harmony. The story keeps you focused and immersed, while the sandbox lets you play your own way, appealing to both story-driven and systems-driven players. The best part? Each system stands strong on its own. Even if you only engage with a fraction of the game’s mechanics, [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] still feels complete and satisfying. It never overwhelms you with what you “should” be doing; instead, it lets you play at your own pace, focusing on the things you enjoy most.\\n\\nFor example, I spent much of the first act focused on exploration and combat, only to realize later that I could’ve been speaking to my animal companions or raising the dead for extra insight! Meanwhile, other players may speed through the story, missing out on the rich environmental puzzles and clever combat tactics. But that’s the beauty of it—everyone can enjoy [i]Baldur’s Gate III[/i] in their own unique way.\\n\\nThis careful balance between focused narrative and emergent gameplay reminds me of the best parts of [i]Deus Ex[/i], and that’s no small praise. [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] is a true achievement.\\n\\n[h2]Beyond the Honeymoon: How [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] Evolves Alongside You[/h2]\\n\\nAs I finished Act 1, what struck me even more than the initial thrill of [i]Baldur’s Gate III[/i] and the delicate balance between the scripted and emergent elements was how the game evolves as you move beyond the honeymoon period.\\n\\nThe introduction gently eases the more story-driven players in with cinematic cutscenes and a strong narrative focus, which makes sense since you need to meet all the characters in your party and understand their motivations. But by midgame, it becomes something different—more open, more mechanically focused, and perhaps even more enjoyable because of it. It’s like a relationship where the early excitement gives way to a deeper, more grounded understanding. What begins as a polished, cinematic adventure turns into a game that embraces its complexity, flaws and all.\\n\\nTake the turn-based combat, for instance. Unlike the real-time systems of earlier games in the series, the slower pace of [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] could easily frustrate some players. However, the early encounters are kept small and simple, easing players into the tactical depth gradually. This approach helps story-focused players adapt, as they may not have expected the slower rhythm of turn-based combat. By midgame, though, this slower pace feels natural—something you’ve grown to understand and appreciate.\\n\\nSimilarly, the absence of a day-night cycle might seem like a limitation, but it’s cleverly hidden by the fixed camera angles, which prevent players from seeing the sky. (This also likely improves performance by reducing the need for rendering distant objects and environments.) By the time you notice this design choice, it feels like a natural part of the world, something you’ve accepted as part of the journey.\\n\\nThis shift is also reflected in character progression. In Act 1, you level up quickly, racing toward level 10 by the end, just shy of the level cap of 12. But in the midgame, the pace slows dramatically, shifting the focus from leveling to acquiring and managing powerful items, and keeping the party buffed through spells and elixirs that you have, by this point, learned to craft. The game becomes more about optimization, strategy, and exploration rather than just hitting the next level. And by this point, the change feels right—you’ve grown with the game, and it no longer needs to rely on instant gratification to keep you engaged.\\n\\nIn the end, [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] reveals itself to be more than just the game you started. What begins as a story-driven RPG transforms into a more open-ended, systems-heavy experience, and by the time you realize it, you’ve come to appreciate both its strengths and its flaws. Like any good relationship, it’s the imperfections that make it unique, and it's the journey that helps you see them in a new light.\"}\n",

      "{'appid': '552520', 'review': '4/10\\n\\n You know the trope: have you played one Ubisoft game, you have played them all. Your first hours are fun and new, even when you’re familiar with the Ubisoft formula. But the more you venture into the world, you’ll realize its just repetitive slog in every game.\\nAnd then , there is this game. Oddly enough, I bought 5 and New Dawn on sale, and played New Dawn first, and had more fun with the latter . There are so many things wrong with this title and I din’t even realize it, most of the time, because  of the fast gameplay loop. Pew..pew…boom. Katshing.\\n\\nThe map is huge and nice to look at, with lots of things to do. Bet you read that one in many other reviews, So its good value for your money then, right? Maybe, when you don’t think about it.\\nIndeed there are lots of mapmakers, a variety of enemies and wildlife, collectables, notes. All the shallow useless activities we know and love in an Ubisoft game.The map is maybe to big for its own good, either way everything feels facile.\\nSide missions are solely designed to send you somewhere, kill or save someone. Liberate this, collect that. Hunt that animal, catch that fish, They somehow provide less than nothing to the overall story, some are cringeworthy at their best, maybe a little edgy.  [spoiler]For example. In one mission they literally send you out to examine dog shit.) [/spoiler]\\nExploration feels as rewarding as the sound , when you reveal a location. Quick and painless. You´ll discover a location, maybe your check for clues or ways to get in. You’ll find weapons, which are worse than your weapon of choice. Loot in crates or rucksacks is abundant, but you can’t collect everything because, you have no room in in your inventory. (Some of a gamers worst feelings is to leave loot behind).\\nNotes and massages in other games benefit to the world building, here they are just bland, written only to be found. Nearly every note in an abandoned lodge or shelter, tells a story, about…someone, who was here, and is now gone. Or in other notes you’ll discover a cult member upset, that they can’t get in a safe room with good loot, only to find in the next note hints HOW to get in,  And don’t let me start on the collectables. NPCs send you out, in a literal war zone to collect…things. Another mechanic to reveal the map, and waste your time.\\n\\nGunplay feels pertinent, but that’s an easy feat nowadays, So every gun type feel the same, only the paint job and the numbers were slightly different.. I saved up some money at the beginning, bought a prestige weapon in every slot and stuck to it to the endgame. Even when you unlock other weapons, they are still uninteresting as boring. Same goes for the vehicles. Bought a boat and  a helicopter, with mounted weapons, a small cart for fast map traversal, and didn’t bother with other options, even when I unlocked more and bigger vehicles. Note here, Ubisoft hits you with a shiny special currency in safes…and provides  a shop to buy more, with real money, to purchase weapons, outfits and vehicles. You definitely won’t need to. To benefit micro transactions they unwillingly broke the progression in that regard.\\n\\n„New character discovered“! One would think, here is someone important to the story or the gameplay. Besides your followers, most new discovered character provides nothing of value to your immersion, maybe one mission or two, just to sent you out to review more locations.  Main characters have more to say and provide, but are boring either. The gun wielding priest, the sheriff, the redneck, the crazy conspiracy theorist, the woman boss, who doesn’t trust you….  In all that I often felt so lost, at times in the open world, I wouldn’t recognize  what character is talking to me through the radio, Enemy variety is…well, there is a variety. Grunts with beards, melee with no hair but beards, tanks with helmets and beards. Generic classes, which look all the same. And yes, devs even joke about it, that enemy NPCs have lots of weapons but nothing to shave the beards of.\\nAs I heart, in SW:Outlaws you can get mission hints by idle chatter in the open world. Nice idea. Here too, except they have a nice marker above their heads, and the provide useless information and a side quest in your journal. Like I said, nice idea. Until you realize, these are sequenced. One npc in the first region can give you a marker on the other side of the map. Until there is no quests left.  Quickly you’ll forget the little story he gave you with that minor quest. That seems dumb, considering all three factions are isolated in three map sections.  One can only wonder, how to they know about things on the other end of the map? Why don’t they all gather up and fight together against the cult army. Oh right, because you, as the protagonist, with the generic name Rookie, have to do their dirty work.\\n\\nThat brings me to story.The story was ludicrous and in its presentation often insufferably bad. Like the antagonistic cult, Ubisoft wants you to believe, there is a deeper meaning to all of it, like there was in Far Cry 3, Even worse. I felt a strong detachment to the overall story and my own character. Triggered cutscenes offensively undermine  that little agenda I had as a player with my silent character. Every banter with the four main villains is shallow and meaningless, when you can’t answer anything or even to shoot em in the face, like you do  90%  of the game time. Their speeches were insulting and bloated like like they know you inside out. But the only thing they really can judge  the player character is, how I as they lay death and destruction upon all of them. Oh yeah, know this…you are part of the big plan, which is….to fill up the resistance meter in every region, to confront the main villain. So the progress in the story also tied to the resistance in said region. Certain milestones trigger events, like radio massages or abductions. I can live with the mechanic, that my adversaries in a certain region mark me, as worthy foe and send out Elites to kill me. But at every big story milestone, they abduct me, only to provide more bloated speeches and a certain way to go back to the regular gameplay. Until the next part. At times I felt offended  by the ridiculous twists and turns it took, triggered by my own progress, and took completely the control out of my handy..  You can’t tell me ,I am chosen to be a part of your big plan, only to send countless followers with assault rifles or rocket launchers after me. I can walk through fogs of this  Macguffin aka Bliss, only to be knocked out all of a sudden, because its time for another story bit. [spoiler]A hallucination literally forces you to unwillingly kill a main ally, only to be told: nevermind, anyway you are the hero.[/spoiler]. And then these endings. I won’t spoil them, but after reading this, you’ll know my opinion.\\n\\n\\nWhy did you play it then, you ask? Because I have this pitiful urge to play my games till the end… this is type of feeling, Ubisoft is using against their customers. Most of the time I had my fair bit of fun, sneaking up on my enemies. sniping them with my bow or raining down my wrath from my helicopter. Pew,pew…boom!  Katshing. Nonetheless, the turning point was, when I had to catch a fish. Yes. A fish. I tried for five hours on two real days. Even when I knew how the mini game works, I had to look things up, only to read, that the fishing on PC may be bugged, or you’ll have to plug in a controller, then you’ll catch it in 30 seconds. It’s an effing war zone, a world ending plot is going on. People disappear, or die and they send my out to catch a fish. After that I began to write this review, and finished the main story within two hours, didn’t bother finish  some remaining side quests. Overall I am giving this flawed game a cross thumb, because of the fun explosions. But something pulls my thumb down…..'}\n",

My second biggest gripe is the map, its not bad and it is very detailed and a nice place to drive around and explore but what made the crew stand out in the first place was the HUGE map in the first and second game it made it feel special like no other arcade racer offered a playable area of that scale.\\nThe Graphics are great and the details like steering wheel and shifter movements are great, the driving physics are vastly improved as well, if they made another game with the scale of Crew 1&2 with the polish and feel of Motorfest it would be an epic game.\\nIf you can get Motorfest on sale its a decent buy otherwise imo The Crew 2 offers way more to do and better value'}\n",

      "{'appid': '1496790', 'review': \"Gotham Knights, the game where you don’t get to be Batman but instead play as his lovable understudies. Think of it as the superhero version of being handed a salad when you ordered a steak—it’s technically food, but it’s not what you wanted.\\n\\nThe game sets up an intriguing premise: Gotham without Batman. But the city itself doesn’t feel drastically different from what we’ve seen in the Arkham games. Sure, the criminals are getting bolder, but the absence of Batman doesn’t feel as world-shaking as you’d expect. Instead, Gotham remains more or less the same chaotic place, only now with four caped crusaders instead of one..\\n\\nPlaying Gotham Knights is like stepping into a pair of oversized Batman boots—except they don’t fit right, and you keep tripping over yourself. Combat is fine, the fluidity of Arkham Knight's combat is gone, replaced with a more simplified, button-mashy style that’s serviceable but less refined. Sure, you’ve got different playstyles with the four Knights—Batgirl’s hacking, Robin’s stealth, Nightwing’s agility, and Red Hood’s raw power—but none of them quite capture the poetic brutality of Arkham's free-flow fighting. The problem is that every time you punch a bad guy, you can’t help but think, “Batman would’ve done that cooler.”\\n\\nGotham Knights swaps out gliding for a Batcycle, which is kind of like trading a jet engine for a moped. The Batcycle gets the job done, but it’s not the most exciting ride. And while each Knight does have their own unique traversal abilities (Batgirl can glide like Batman, Nightwing has a Fortnite glider, Robin teleports, and Red Hood jumps around like an angry superhuman), it lacks the thrilling simplicity of Batman’s cape-glide and grapple combo. The movement feels more clunky and less like you’re a stealthy creature of the night.\\n\\nGotham City looks fantastic, as it always does, but it’s less “living, breathing city” and more “superhero theme park”. Everywhere you turn, there’s a conveniently placed group of thugs just waiting for a beatdown.  The side quests are... there. Solve crimes, beat up people, rinse, repeat. But what truly stands out is how every crime feels like the same crime, just copy-pasted into different alleys. I mean, if you’ve fought one Gotham thug, you’ve fought them all. Even the goons look like they’re unionized into using the same 3 wardrobe sets.\\n\\nGotham Knights is fun in its own right—especially with the co-op aspect—but it lacks the refined combat, thrilling traversal, and immersive world that made Arkham Knight so iconic. If you go into the game expecting Batman: Arkham Knight 2, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.\"}\n",

      "{'appid': '1496790', 'question': 'Does Gotham Knights allow for killing or is it focused more on stealth?'}\n",
      "{'appid': '1496790', 'review': 'First, I\\'d like to preface to everyone, this is NOT in anyway related to the Arkham series. Not in gameplay, nor story.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow with that out of the way lets start with one subject that bothers a lot of people nowadays. DEI.\\r\\nThis game does have DEI in it, but not in a way that I think woke people would want. A lot of the criminals are women for some reason, which would be normal for the league of shadows but not every mob. And there are a few pride flags hidden around the place. The one in the belfry is on the top floor, an area you\\'ll go to only for certain optional story segments, and a few references of pride parades in emails, that most people will not read. So on the DEI part of the game I\\'d say they just did the bare minimum to get their paycheck without affecting the game or story.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameplay: This isn\\'t Arkham, as I said earlier. It does not have a slingshot combat system with an emphasis on countering attacks. It is more akin to a Spiderman game. You have your melee light/heavy attacks where heavy attacks end combos, And you have a light and heavy ranged attack where heavy has no combo but act as an AoE that can hit multiple enemies and dodging enemies. Other than that you can aim your ranged and dodge in a character specific manner.\\r\\nEvery character has their own skill sets that differentiate the way they play.\\r\\nNightwing is an acrobat so he jumps from target to target very quickly, having a special abilities promote this playstyle, such as an ability to pounce on an enemy, bounce and then grapple towards the next enemy.\\r\\nRed-hood has a ranged playstyle, with greater aimed shot damage, better attack rate with range and abilities that allow him to unload his guns on anyone infront of him.\\r\\nBatgirl is a more balanced fighter, using both her melee and ranged to great effect, using her grapple to bring enemies closer to her and having a variety of special abilities that do no focus on any single asspect of gameplay.\\r\\nRobin is best at AoE and stealth, using his bo-staff to hit multiple enemies at once and quickly disappearing from combat. Being the only one who can stealth knockout large enemies and use perches to tie enemies up, Robin is amazing when stealth is your favorite aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking of stealth... Since each character has a different playstyle, stealth may feel a bit off for certain characters. Everyone can sneak around, silently take down smaller opponents from any direction, be it from behind, hanging above them, below them or even while mid air or rushing them down quickly before they can alert anyone. But some characters aren\\'t that great at it. Mainly being Red-hood. He is a lot clumsier, and can make you feel like something is really off with the stealth.\\r\\nFor example, every character can aim their ranged attack to attract an enemy to a certain location, but Red-hood uses guns which doesn\\'t make much sense that the enemies will be attracted to the point of impact instead of the source of the gunshot. But hey, it still works...\\r\\nAnd both Robin and Batgirl have special abilities for stealth that Nightwing and Red-hood don\\'t have which increases the off feeling for stealth while playing them.\\r\\nOverall, both the combat and stealth are quite satisfying and fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nStory: The story of the game is servicable. it starts off with an awesome cutscene of batman fighting Ra\\'s Al Ghoul, ending with the death of both and the call to action to our 4 heroes. The game is filled with beautifully made and choreographed cutscenes that are specific to the host player\\'s character, meaning that the story can unfold with 4 variations. The story is still the same, but the attention to detail in the interactions between different characters and the different characters of the main cast is great to see, and IMO is sorely needed in other games that include multiple playable pre-made characters.\\r\\nOther than that, the story falls to mediocraty due to the supporting cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoot and progression: Now we\\'re getting into one of the biggest controversy around this game. This game was planned to be a \"games as a service\" type game, and so it include loot and a rudamentry crafting system. And at first glance this system seems like it\\'s important. That it may force you to play a single character and not allow you to enjoy everyone else, or that it will require grinding between story sections. But no, it\\'s actually not that important. Levels are shared for all four heroes, and after every mission you get specific loot for all four characters that is usually better than what you can craft. It does affect end-game, where when you do \"Heroic assault\" This game\\'s dungeon system, you will only get rewards for the specific character you played. Other than that, getting loot is easy, resources are plentiful, and other than a bit a of a drop in power for a few moments after selecting a different character, you come back really quickly.\\r\\nThe downside of this system is that it makes the difficulty of the game spike up and down really drastically.\\r\\nThe game uses a gearscore system, called power, that doesn\\'t really tell you how good your gear is, but simply give an arbitrary number. A 300 power weapon can be weaker than a 100 power weapon, it all depends on the other stats. But the rest of the game follows the power system and adjusts according to that, so you may find yourself with over 1000 power but doing little damage, or the opposite, having 500 power but one-shotting everyone.\\r\\nAlso, enemies have their health and to a lesser degree, their damage, tied to their tier. Regular shooter can be one shot while a veteran may need a bit of a pounding. You\\'d expect that the level next to their health be a more accurate indicator of their power, but not really. Stealth, on the other hand, really balances things out since everyone KO\\'s instantly to stealth, and grapple attacks do so much damage that they either insta KO or remove over half of any enemy\\'s health-bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraversal and Open-world: Gotham is a beautiful city, it has shanty-town like  slums, colorful streets with neon signs everywhere lighting up the smog and fog of the city. It has beautiful old sections lined with cobblestone and brick buildings, along the more modern streets with their clean and slick deisgnes. There\\'s art in every corner of this city. Activities in the city are quite normal for open-world games these days. You got random crimes going on around. They can be mugging, attempts to break into buildings, beating up cops, etc. And there\\'s the pre-maditated crimes, which can be more engaging. Bank robberies, Kidnapping, gang wars, etc. Other than that you get the regular activities. Collectibles and races, which we\\'ll get into later.\\r\\nThe rest of Gotham might seem a bit dead. Certain areas are more densely populated than others, but you don\\'t tend to see large groups of people or cars. But this can be explained with the high rate of criminality in Gotham. When passing civilians, some will be in awe of seeing you, most will be apathetic, while others will either shame you or get away from you hinting to the fact that they are likely criminals themselves. Which makes Gotham a dangerous place to walk around at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, how do you traverse Gotham city? Every one of the Bat-family has accesses to their own Motorcycle (batcycle) which can be speedy enough to go around, but after a completing a few early game challanges you can unlock a character specific movement system. Batgirl gets to glide like Batman speeding downwards and converting speed to upwards lift when needed. Robin gets to teleport short distances (I say short, but it\\'s about 300 meters per jump). Nightwing gets a Jet Glider that allows him to fly at a constant rate. While Red-hood gets a mystical jump that allows him to jump on magic platforms in the air, prolonging the distance he can jump. Other than that, every character gets their own grapple to zip around the city, and small arenas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the game is quite good'}\n",

      "{'appid': '1496790', 'review': 'It\\'s a hollow product that should have stayed in the oven for at least two more years - I went into the game knowing full well it was bad, still I was surprised in both good and bad ways. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s start with the good things: amazing aesthetic of city design, good looking suits and touching side story sequences. The design team did their job wonderfully and gave us a Gotham design that\\'s almost on par with Arkham Knight\\'s Gotham. Still it lacks substance - the staggering absence of details around the city, and the unvaried building structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real downsides of Gotham Knights are many, namely the horrendous gameplay, bad story progression, uncreative and repetitive side activities, etc. Its combat takes away all the things that made Batman Arkham games great, and gives us a jankier Sleeping Dogs. Sometimes it\\'s required to do Ubisoft-styled missions in order to progress story, meaning you have to find \"clues\" or interrogate thugs through random events. The story progression system is truly evolving backwards. The batcycle is slow AF, the game has to add a wind blowing filter to make it look fast lol. There\\'re also a tons of what I consider to be minor issues, like NPCs repeat lines way too often, NPC models vanish soon as enter a camera blind spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll those I can still endure. But my current biggest gripe with it is the the genuinely unfun experience resulting from a combination of widely scattered side activities and severely downgraded (from the Batman Arkham games) traversal system. Gliding and grappling speed is somewhere between Arkham City and Knight, but the traversal as a whole feels wrong on many level - there\\'s no physics or a good sense of control to it. And the lack of detail in Gotham only makes going around the map even worse. \\r\\n\\r\\nTL;DR - the design dev team is 9/10 but the gameplay dev team is 5/10'}\n",

Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great—it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you’re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws.

A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you’re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment.

Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying.

It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable.

      "{'appid': '794540', 'review': 'Giving it a thumbs up but with heavy reservations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeo Cab has us take a role of Lina, a cab driver in a neo-futuristic city. She\\'s just moved in to the city to live with her best friend from the past whom she hasn\\'t seen in ages. However, on the first night, her friend goes missing and Lina takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her friend and who is responsible while at the same time trying to make a living by driving passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a sense, Neo Cab is a hybrid of a visual novel story and management gameplay which involves serving customers, making enough money to get by, and making sure your star rating stays high. Normally, this kind of genre mixing can be risky, but what the game has is connected well enough, without either aspect getting in the way of the other. The story is giving us an end goal to strive towards, whereas the management aspect is giving us something to do and think about while we\\'re progressing through the plot. The gameplay isn\\'t complicated really and all you need to keep track of are your money and your rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile transporting customers, we get to learn a bit about them. They come in all kinds, the young and the old, the boring and the weird, the friendly and the hostile. Most (if not all) of them we get to meet multiple times throughout the game, so we get to know them really well and they could end up even helping us along during the main plot. In the way the customers are integrated into the game\\'s story is pretty decent because we do learn something from each of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the game loop is quite simple - you drive 3 customers per night, and occasionally visit some story-related location, then spend the night at a motel or one of those futuristic capsules, and then do the same the next night till six nights have passed. I personally was quite surprised how quickly and somewhat abruptly the game ended. I kind of expected it to go on for longer, with investigation taking more nights and requiring more tasks on our behalf, but it was pretty short and for many players might feel rather underwhelming. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe game\\'s world is interesting and tackles interesting subjects relating to the near future, particularly automation of the workforce and the ways in which corporations could use and abuse new technology for their own personal benefit. But the main plot of searching for your friend and uncovering what on Earth she got involved in fell rather short in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we interact with customers and any other characters, we often are given dialogue choices of what to say. This can impact how they feel about us and whether they would give us a good rating or share important information with us. One annoyance though that many other players seem to agree with is that the game often doesn\\'t let you pick the dialogue choices you want to pick, possibly because the character is not in the right mood or something, so they outright refuse to say what you tell them to say. And speaking of their mood - it seems to jump all over the place at the drop of a hat, and this can be very hard to keep track of, especially that most times it really isn\\'t clear how a particular dialogue branch will affect her mood. Most times you might as well just taking a wild guess at it (we can see how her mood gets changed due to a device she starts wearing on her wrist from early on in the game).\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphically the game is magnificent. In fact, the visuals are probably its biggest strength. The whole art style is very colourful, pleasing and in great style, fitting that neo-future aesthetic the game is going for. Coupled with decent background music in the style of synthwave, and the game is pretty enjoyable in its presentation. There is no voice acting here, which to some players may seem odd for a game like this, but to me personally it wasn\\'t a big deal as I just treated it as a visual novel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the save system could be vastly improved though. It isn\\'t clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn\\'t save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don\\'t see a reason why the game couldn\\'t just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn\\'t save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I\\'d say, if you\\'re not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you\\'re not missing out.

I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable!

      "Are the graphics in Watch_Dogs impressive for a game released in 2014?\n",
      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\\n\\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\\n\\nI played God of War: Ragnarök earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'Sony needs to learn their lesson.

      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'God of War Ragnarök is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]'}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"If you played God of War (2018) and liked it, then you'll like Ragnarok as well. The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.\"}]\n"

      "Is the overall tone of Watch_Dogs 2 more comedic and less serious than its predecessor?\n",
      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\\n\\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\\n\\nI played God of War: Ragnarök earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"This game requires a playstation network account to play and the support for reactivating such an account is spotty at best. \\n\\nUnfortunate because I loved its predecessor.\\n\\nAt the time of writing I am unable to access my PSN account due to a recent two factor identification update that I was not aware of and have no way to provide.

I can't play this game at the moment.\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"Finished it, got all the achievements, now I can easily confirm that what I said earlier was true. The game is spectacular, it's just one of THOSE GAMES where you just want to forget everything the second you are done with the game just so you can play it for the first time again. I love the series, love the story, love the characters and especially creatures in the game. Also the DLC although kinda repetitive, still fun for a few hours and it's free so yeah. No horrible performance issues either = my mouse stopped working once (restart fixed it), dropped frames few times (it was for a few seconds so i'm cool with it), and my game dropped once (i have 72 hours and my game dropped ONCE) so idk what everyone else is talking about but it's in the state of playable for sure and jesus giving negative review because of PSN accounts when it's so easily avoidable is just annoying, the same way Sony is with forcing it on people. As I said before, go have fun with it!!\\n\\nOkay I usually make reviews after 100%ing the game, but this time I can't help myself but give it now because I feel like most of the negative reviews are either due to the PSN accounts (which don't get me wrong, it does really suck but I don't think the game deserve the hate for something Sony does, it's not fair to the people that gave it hundreds of hours creating, they really did not make that stupid decision) and the other ones are because of optimization? I did not stumble upon any big issues regarding that, if I don't count one boat floating in the air lmao. I had chills playing this game from the first minute, I can't wait what's ahead of me and these negative reviews should not make you reconsider buying the game. Trust me, if you liked the first one, you will love the second one:) I do not regret paying 60 euros for such a gem. Now go have fun with it!!\"}]\n"

      "Are there any details about the gameplay mechanics in Dustborn that could affect my enjoyment of the game?\n",
      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\\n\\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\\n\\nI played God of War: Ragnarök earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'God of War Ragnarök is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]'}]\n"

After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition.

The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game.

Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}]\n"

The game is spectacular, it's just one of THOSE GAMES where you just want to forget everything the second you are done with the game just so you can play it for the first time again. I love the series, love the story, love the characters and especially creatures in the game. Also the DLC although kinda repetitive, still fun for a few hours and it's free so yeah. No horrible performance issues either = my mouse stopped working once (restart fixed it), dropped frames few times (it was for a few seconds so i'm cool with it), and my game dropped once (i have 72 hours and my game dropped ONCE) so idk what everyone else is talking about but it's in the state of playable for sure and jesus giving negative review because of PSN accounts when it's so easily avoidable is just annoying, the same way Sony is with forcing it on people. As I said before, go have fun with it!!\\n\\nOkay I usually make reviews after 100%ing the game, but this time I can't help myself but give it now because I feel like most of the negative reviews are either due to the PSN accounts (which don't get me wrong, it does really suck but I don't think the game deserve the hate for something Sony does, it's not fair to the people that gave it hundreds of hours creating, they really did not make that stupid decision) and the other ones are because of optimization?

Demanding an account sign up is just ridiculous and completely unnecessary. You're literally losing sales from players all over the world who want to play this otherwise amazing game. You're also making it difficult for paying customers on Steam Deck and Linux to play this game on the platform of their choice. You were gaining so much good will before with your PC ports. Gamers were literally double dipping and buying your games twice just to play on PC, but you've absolutely squandered that good will with the PSN requirement.

Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition.

The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}]\n"

I'm currently getting between 30-45 fps, low settings, AMD FSR 3.1 balanced , vsync off, fps limit off.

I am actually able to play AMD FSR Quality between 30-45 fps I've now unlocked the refresh rate via steam deck settings and it is smoother than when I previously locked  it to 36fps.

I did not stumble upon any big issues regarding that, if I don't count one boat floating in the air lmao. I had chills playing this game from the first minute, I can't wait what's ahead of me and these negative reviews should not make you reconsider buying the game.

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'God of War Ragnarök is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable!

It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]'}]\n"

You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}]\n"

I love the series, love the story, love the characters and especially creatures in the game. Also the DLC although kinda repetitive, still fun for a few hours and it's free so yeah. No horrible performance issues either = my mouse stopped working once (restart fixed it), dropped frames few times (it was for a few seconds so i'm cool with it), and my game dropped once (i have 72 hours and my game dropped ONCE) so idk what everyone else is talking about but it's in the state of playable for sure and jesus giving negative review because of PSN accounts when it's so easily avoidable is just annoying, the same way Sony is with forcing it on people.

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}]\n"

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues.

I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others!

You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}]\n"

      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'Seriously misguiding players with this PSN requirement... \\n\\n1) when you launch it, it basically asks you to sign into PSN or quit the game\\n\\n2) but then after having already made a PSN account, it seems you dont even NEED to be signed in on the game to play it...\\n\\n3) I was never asked to sign back into PSN.... make up your mind SONY, why did you lie to me with the first POPUP? saying either sign in or quit?!\\n\\n\\nOtherwise its a visually beautiful game so far. \\n\\n\\nDecent game so far but I should not have to make a PSN game to enjoy a game I paid full price for.'}]\n"

I think this will push people to pirate the game. Hopefully someone creates a mod to remove this completely unnecessary requirement.\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': 'God of War Ragnarök is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]'}]\n"

The game is spectacular, it's just one of THOSE GAMES where you just want to forget everything the second you are done with the game just so you can play it for the first time again. I love the series, love the story, love the characters and especially creatures in the game. Also the DLC although kinda repetitive, still fun for a few hours and it's free so yeah. No horrible performance issues either = my mouse stopped working once (restart fixed it), dropped frames few times (it was for a few seconds so i'm cool with it), and my game dropped once (i have 72 hours and my game dropped ONCE) so idk what everyone else is talking about but it's in the state of playable for sure and jesus giving negative review because of PSN accounts when it's so easily avoidable is just annoying, the same way Sony is with forcing it on people. As I said before, go have fun with it!!\\n\\nOkay I usually make reviews after 100%ing the game, but this time I can't help myself but give it now because I feel like most of the negative reviews are either due to the PSN accounts (which don't get me wrong, it does really suck but I don't think the game deserve the hate for something Sony does, it's not fair to the people that gave it hundreds of hours creating, they really did not make that stupid decision) and the other ones are because of optimization? I did not stumble upon any big issues regarding that, if I don't count one boat floating in the air lmao.

It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]'}]\n"

The thing is my brother lives in a country where this game is blocked to be purchased on Steam by Sony. Let me repeat myself - Steam platform is legal and supported in that country, but Sony said Valve to block their new games from said country. There is absolutely no reason to do this. No justification. I understand Sony is blocking some countries from their own platform - PSN for reasons, but telling Valve to block countries that Steam supports for any other game except all upcoming Sony published games is just complete disaster. My brother has even bought most of previous Sony games that are still to this day available on Steam for purchase, but all of a sudden all newly released and upcoming single player games are blocked.\\nThe dumbest part is that my brother was forced to move to one of EU countries, not some jungle or desert in middle of nowhere, it is EU country and Sony forced Valve to block the country for absolutely no reason from buying some single player games.\\nThis is just wrong, very very wrong!'}]\n"

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}]\n"

The thing is my brother lives in a country where this game is blocked to be purchased on Steam by Sony.

No justification. I understand Sony is blocking some countries from their own platform - PSN for reasons, but telling Valve to block countries that Steam supports for any other game except all upcoming Sony published games is just complete disaster. My brother has even bought most of previous Sony games that are still to this day available on Steam for purchase, but all of a sudden all newly released and upcoming single player games are blocked.\\nThe dumbest part is that my brother was forced to move to one of EU countries, not some jungle or desert in middle of nowhere, it is EU country and Sony forced Valve to block the country for absolutely no reason from buying some single player games.\\nThis is just wrong, very very wrong!'}]\n"

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"Sorry for the countries that cannot make PSN accounts and there for can't play the game I fully feel for you.

Steam deck users, not sure why but I didnt have to log into PSN via steam deck for some odd reason. Pressed play, got a black screen briefly and then the game loaded.\\n\\nNow for people who want to know if this runs on the steam deck. I'm currently getting between 30-45 fps, low settings, AMD FSR 3.1 balanced , vsync off, fps limit off. Steam deck settings I've now locked the fps here as leaving it at 90fps I found it was a bit choppy. I've locked it to 36 fps and 1 hour in the game feels pretty damn smooth.\\n\\nEdit: after playing further into the game when reaching svartalfheim there was a pretty big tank in performance on the steam deck. Upon entering svartalfheim I got roughly 25-30 fps some times dropping to 20 fps, however, after reaching the free roam area via boat the performance increased. I am actually able to play AMD FSR Quality between 30-45 fps I've now unlocked the refresh rate via steam deck settings and it is smoother than when I previously locked  it to 36fps.

      "What themes are explored in Neo Cab through its narrative and character interactions?\n",
      "[{'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\\n\\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\\n\\nI played God of War: Ragnarök earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\"}, {'appid': '2322010', 'review': \"When you boot up the game you are given 2 options: create a PSN account or quit the game...
