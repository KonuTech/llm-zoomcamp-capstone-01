      "  [*]Yet another Ubisoft game with fillers above fillers. Quantity > Quality.\n",
      "  [*]The game overall is too longs. With such an amount of things to do, it is easy to get distracted. It is a personal view as someone might find this as a positive, but after so many hours I just lost interest to move forward.\n",
      "  [*]The combats is getting repetitive after a while. The skill tree even if it is big, lacks skills that will impact the combat.\n",
      "  [*]The base building although interesting in the beginning, does not bring much value to your characters. It is an add-on that after a while you might forget it even exist.\n",

      "[hr]\n",

      "Even though I recommend this game, it is easy to notice the amount of cons comparing to pros. I think that Ubisoft with it know-how on world building could do some amazing stuff, but almost every game it puts the quantity value above quality. I would love to see the % of people that actually finish their games. Assassin's Creed Valhalla, as well as most Ubisoft games are good if you buy them on a ~ 50% discount. Then their games are worth it and you will have a good time knowing that those hours you put into their games did not cost you any absurd amount of money, just absurd amount of time before putting it on a \"unfinished\" shelve.\n",

      "Review: Coming from a lifelong fan of the Assassin's Creed games, I have to say that AC Valhalla is quite a different direction that the franchise has taken. But is that really a bad thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Veering off the long-beaten path, Valhalla presents an absolutely massive open-world map with breathtaking landscapes, and even additional realms of travel beyond the base-game's area (various trips to additional nations, locations, etc). This is quite a stark change from the founding games, and one that has been progressively added to since AC Origins. Another stark difference of Valhalla is the divorce between the traditional combat and stealth we've always known. No longer are the days where stealth is a requirement for an Assassin's Creed game. Now, you are a brute of a viking with a big, heavy ax, and subtlety is not exactly your strong suit. \n",
      "\n",
      "These two major changes were enough to scare off many AC traditionalist, but to put it frankly? The tradition AC format was getting old. How many times can you creep through a building and stalk rooftops to pounce on some dude until you get bored. For me, it was 15 years. I, for one, love the chance that has been made (so far) and look forward to the new face of the Assassin's Creed. Lets hope they don't f*** it up.\n",
