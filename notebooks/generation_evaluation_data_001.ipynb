       "  'review': \"I usually shun major AAA games in favor of small indie publishers. So when this game first came out and got a lot of attention, I ignored it, thinking it was overrated. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to give Baldur's Gate 3 a try. Boy, have I been missing out.\\r\\n\\r\\nGame play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons. There are nice tie-ins to the series that D&D players (including myself) will appreciate, such as certain races like elves and half-elves having dark vision, critical successes and critical failures, and classes like bards, wizards, and fighters. One key difference between the game and D&D is that in Baldur's Gate 3, instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn, initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat. Knowledge of D&D isn't required to play though, as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the game really shines is all of its content. There are so many classes, paladin, barbarian, fighter, druid, cleric, bard, and monk, and just as many races too. Many classes and races also have sub-classes or sub-races, which allows in-depth customization of your characters. The only problem with this is customizing your first character (assuming you don't choose a pre-made one) can take a very long time, especially if you're indecisive like me. My first character Daelis, was a Wild Magic Sorcerer, and I had a cleric, fighter, and rogue in my party. Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story was very enjoyable (no spoilers here!). You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with far-reaching consequences throughout, this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential. I liked how my party members' backstories diverged and intersected with the main story. Each character was well-written and fully-fleshed out, which made it feel like a real D&D campaign. There isn't much replayability when it comes to the main story. You can make different decisions, which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same. Unlike D&D there is only one campaign. Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second. Replayability is instead found in game play and quests. It's impossible to complete every quest, especially every party member's unique quests, in one play through. All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value. You can also recruit different party members than last time, resulting in new character interactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only complaint is saving in the game. There is an auto-save system, but it only activates after you enter important areas. You're forced to manually quick-save most of the time. I eventually got the hang of it, but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quick-save and lost progress. I played on the Balanced difficulty, which is essentially normal, and struggled during many fights. I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing. That's more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though. If you play a lot of casual games and don't have experience with RPGs, I'd recommend the Narrative or easy mode. Things will still be challenging, it's just your blood pressure won't spike as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this is a good game for anyone who likes D&D or story-rich RPGs with lots of content.\",\n",

I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play, and oh boy was I wrong. This is truly a masterpiece; the level of depth in this game is insane. It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and D&D as a whole.\\n\\nAt first, the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me, resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone. But I'm glad it's there because it just makes it that much more replayable. This level of choice continues throughout the game, ensuring your experience is what you want it to be.\\n\\nMost of these longer story games end up tiring me out, so I just rush through to the end to not feel like I've wasted the time I spent on it already. BG3 is an exception to that; despite being the longest game out of all of them, I truly enjoyed the whole journey.\\n\\nBefore I even finished the game, I already couldn't wait to do another playthrough with mods and different choices.

       "  'review': \"Baldur’s Gate III is an isometric turn based action roleplaying game developed by Larian Studios of the Divinity Franchise fame. The origins for Baldur’s Gate III itself starts back in 2001, with Black Isle Studios digging into development for the third game after Bioware’s work on the first two Baldur’s Gate games and Snowblind Studio’s success on the spin-off Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance. It apparently would have no returning Baldur’s Gate characters and would tie into the Icewind Dale series along with the upcoming Dark Alliance 2. However, s h i t got f u c k ed up over at Interplay and they lost the rights to Dungeons and Dragons and had since decided to move onto the soon to be cancelled Van Buren project (aka Isometric Fallout 3). Soon afterwards, Interplay would continue to struggle repeatedly and would soon fall off of the gaming world amid lawsuits over the Baldur’s Gate name, which would soon land on Atari of all things. There would be attempts at a revival by Brian Fargo (head of Interplay at that time) and Beamdog (the guys behind remastering BG1 & 2), but it would take a much longer time to find a home. This home would be Larian Studios, who would attempt to pitch Baldur’s Gate III repeatedly to D&D owners Wizard of the Coast, and after the success of Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2, Wizards would give them the greenlight. They would tease the game in 2019 and release it in Early Access a couple of years later, even tying in an actual D&D prequel module named Baldur’s Gate: Descent Into Avernus. \\n\\nMy introduction into Baldur’s Gate III was one with little fanfare; I’ve seen it around a whole bunch of times and I knew that the game was descended from a series whose roots delve into CRPG territory like Fallout and Planescape: Torment. Having seen it out in early access and had a couple of friends show interest, I bought it once or twice for them but hadn’t thought anything of it since. However, Summer of 2023 had me fly overseas to the UK in honestly one of the best times of my life to meet up with some of my best friends. Talking about games in the living room of one of my friends, Wrathne had talked about the game a bit again as it was being released in August of that year. I made a mental note of it but nothing else and I flew back to go back to the depressing normal existence we call life. However, this game BLEW the hell up in both my personal life and the gaming world; everyone and my grandmother was playing this game and having seen it get the Game of the Year including my Gs BFD Survivor (a bit) and Wrathne. I had kinda brainstormed that perhaps I would get it so that we could do a cooperative campaign together someday, and after a bit of pestering I got the game from Wrathne for Christmas (shoutout to the Big Homie). I didn’t really end up playing that until three months later but with someone else as everyone was either busy or was into other games at that time, and having been late to the party I figured “why not” and gave it a shot. \\n\\nI started this game as Dark Wizard Christofer Florentin, an ancient being whose main goal in life is to f u c k mad b i t c hes and show everyone who's boss. The game’s writing is so damn good, I ended up monogamous with Shadowheart and saving the entire world instead of ruling it, becoming the Grey Wizard in the process. While to be fair, the game won’t let you sleep with everyone unless you have mods, I’m not sure I would’ve done that anyways. All the characters are well written with fleshed out personalities, character motivations, goals, likeability, it’s purely amazing what they’ve done here and I don’t even care for fantasy that much. I’ve both cried a bit and giggled at the antics in game, shared numerous adventures with my party including dark elf ranger Elza the Taciturn (shoutout to Nibbles) and lizard ninja The Hand (shoutout to my roommate Austin) as we’ve tackled ancient murder cults, lovecraftian monsters, serial killers, demons, robots, slavers, ogres and goblins and all kinds of random stuff. One minute you’ll be hunting vampires for your bi-s e xual vampire buddy Astarion, the next minute you’ll be attempting to stop a bank robbery. The best part? Every quest ties into each other whilst simultaneously having a personality of their own, and random encounters are everywhere with each location providing new things that one can’t possibly see in their first playthrough. \\n\\nhttps://www.backloggd.com/u/gamemast15r/review/1896932/ (For pretty much most of the review, click here; most sources in this link but some are at bottom)\\n\\nBaldur’s Gate III was an RPG that I had picked up just to play cooperatively with some friends, a session that sadly I didn’t end up doing but would love to make up some day. I ended up coming out of it glad it’s finally over, but sad that I had to leave. I missed my grand adventure, watching as Elza the Taciturn would loot actual corpses to throw at bosses later on and trying to romance Shadowheart while convincing a group of elves to rise up against their slave masters. I miss this game even now. But wait, why not just replay it again? The first playthrough will always be a once in a lifetime impression, one that I’d rather sit on and wait for a long time before re-discovering everything again in the future. It definitely made an impact on me, making me realize that I miss both the in-game friends I made as well as cherishing all the good times I’ve had with my friends outside in the real world. The game and its world are the definition of fun, and this game went from a complete “eh let’s try it” to “this is a certified hood classic, buy this mixtape out of the trunk of my non-existent car”. Even if you think this game is a bunch of nerd fantasy s h i t or you don’t like the style of game? Give it a try, Baldur’s Gate III is a gem and is worth all the money you can possibly give and more. I didn’t end up buying this game though technically, as stated my friend Wrathne got me a copy for Christmas of 2023, so shout out to the Big Homie for the copy. Baldur’s Gate III is worth sixty dollars now, it was worth thirty dollars then, and it’s worth whatever the amount of money you would like to throw at it; this game has become one of my favorites of all time and I feel sad for uninstalling the game. But when time grows apart, a longing to return home bubbles up and eventually I know I’ll come back to this game for some cooperative fun. Hell, the next time I play this game all the way through, I’ll probably write up the review to be a bit better because the truth is at the moment that I’m VERY biased towards this game and feel like I could potentially do better, especially considering that there’s so much content that I know I didn’t even see it all.\\n\\nLinks:\\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4\\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated \\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/ \\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-september \\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/astarion-was-a-tiefling-in-an-early-version-of-baldurs-gate-3-gdc-panel-reveals \\nhttps://www.belloflostsouls.net/2024/08/dd-beyond-walks-back-2024-changes.html#:~:text=Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast%20kicked,the%20new%20D%26D%202024%20ruleset. \\nhttps://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-fans-win-ogl-controversy-good-wotc/ \\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/6JR4qLOXu96krMWxBTpXSR\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vofkw9-O18c&list=PLi1CK-rsvz1Nfz83RMBp_9YaIgBWd0l9x&index=2 \\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt13258344/ \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9-xtPlIx7s&list=WL&index=99&t=6s \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDDrf2w6a10&list=WL&index=103&t=4s\\nhttps://www.winterwind-productions.com/an-interview-with-damien-foletto-part-2/\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] A MASTERPIECE WORTH EVERY MINUTE! [/h1]\\n\\nLike, I literally can\\'t say this any louder! I’ve been absolutely blown away by this game. After investing over 370 hours, I can confidently say that it’s been one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had in my +16 years of gaming!\\n\\nAs someone who’s relatively new to games like Baldur\\'s Gate 3, The game has done wonders in introducing me to the complexities of D&D within a digital realm. The adaptation of traditional tabletop mechanics into a seamless and engaging gameplay experience is nothing short of remarkableness.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, the world of Faerûn feels alive and immersive, thanks to the stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The narrative is very engaging and full of twists, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful. The voice acting and character interactions are absolutely top-notch! Bringing the story and its inhabitants to life in a way that’s truly memorable.\\n\\nWhat really sets Baldur’s Gate 3 apart is its depth. With hundreds of quests, countless choices, and a variety of playstyles, there’s always something new to discover. The replayability is off the charts! Each playthrough can be a completely different experience! The flexibility in character creation and party dynamics allows you to craft a unique adventure every time.\\n\\nIf you’re a fan of RPGs in general or just looking for a game that offers a rich, engaging experience, Baldur’s Gate 3 is more than worth your time. My 370+ hours are a testament to its insane quality and replayability. This game has completely set a new standard for the genre! And I highly recommend it to anyone!\\n\\nThat said, if there is one \"downside\" that I could possible think of that is worth mentioning about Baldur\\'s Gate 3, It has to be the fact that it may not be the most welcoming for players who are completely new to the D&D aspect of the game [u] (Like me!) [/u] . The depth and complexity of the D&D mechanics can be daunting quite a bit at first, and it takes some time to fully grasp the nuances if you’re unfamiliar with the system. However, this challenge is also a blessing in disguise. It pushes you to learn and appreciate the intricacies of D&D, enriching your overall experience and deepening your understanding of the game’s mechanics. If you’re like me and are very excited to dive into the beauty of RPG with a truly remarkable blend with D&D, The feeling of immersion is something to totally embrace! \\n\\n[h3] ALSO! [/h3]\\n\\nI’m incredibly excited to see what Patch 7 has in store and how it will further enhance this already amazing game! A huge shoutout to Larian Studios and everyone who worked on this project. Your dedication and passion have created an absolute masterpiece and This game is a testament to your incredible talent and hard work, and I’m grateful for the unforgettable adventure you’ve given us all! \\n\\n[b] From the bottom of my heart. Thank you SO SO much! ♡ [/b]\\n',\n",

You have to deal with a rest system that is difficult to integrate in a natural game flow, the hit/miss mechanics that can make you play entire turns with no result, and a progression system that makes you choose between straight up improving your character or getting access to minor fun options. None of those make the game bad, but it makes you wonder how good the game would have been if it wasn\\'t tainted by D&D.\\n💭 Narratively it also suffers from being set in Forgotten Realms due to how much the worldbuilding relies on there being \"evil\" races to justify having default antagonists the player won\\'t feel bad about killing. The game tries to timidly tackle the subject a few times, but all the goblins you see are still evil raiders, and it is never questioned.\\n\\n❌ There is one major dissonance between what the narration conveys and what is expected from the player - the game sets up a huge feeling of urgency right from the start, pushing the player to hurry up and take as few breaks as possible, while a lot of the game\\'s events actually need long rests to occur, and there are no downsides to resting (apart from possibly running out of resources, but that isn\\'t really a factor either, you find a lot of food). Just know that there is no hurry, and you need to rest quite often to not miss interesting narrative content.\\n\\nOverall, Baldur\\'s Gate 3 manages the feat of being a wonderful game despite being based on a mediocre game system and being set in a mediocre fantasy setting - you actually feel the amount of effort it took to swim against the current here and produce something so good in the end. It makes me even more optimistic about the next game by Larian Studios - if I could get any more optimistic after Divinity Original Sin 2.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Baldurs Gate 3 is by far one of the best games I've ever played in my life so far...I could stop there but I'll elaborate. This game just warms and hugs my D&D nerd heart...for this a game made for fans of D&D and every fantasy lover out there. The game lore is rich with so much details and bit and bobs to discover, the story is epic and will stay with me for the rest of life. Some of the best turn-based combat I've ever seen in a video game you have so many options of what you can do and you don't have to simply attack you can throw shit, jump, shove, light your sword on fire, throw a barrel of explosives, heal your ally by throwing a potion at them (it just works lol) and etc. It's so intricate and so well crafted...and lastly there's one other thing I wanna talk about...the companions...I will start with the order I met them don't worry I will be using spoiler texts. I really worry I may repeat shit for various characters lol\\n\\nLae'zel is an absolute unit, besides that she comes across as rude and not exactly friendly it's more like she comes from place where everyone had the attitude or that outlook and by all things that may point to the contrary...Lae'zel is the nicest githyanki alive..she's got a heart of gold under that armour, she's brave as all hell and she can be quite socially awkward and I love her...and she also happens to my favourite..whether she be dispatching foes as a fighter or the times I've changed her into a Paladin...god does she wreck people as a Paladin...\\n\\nShadowheart was the character I romanced with my first character and by god am I glad I did, Shadowheart is such a sweet person and she's very witty and the absolute best...like my god her story is so well done and I love watching her transform as a person throughout and various moments of quiet spent along her are moments well spent..and my god does she mess people up with that spirit guardians...favourite thing to do just sprint past enemies with spirit guardians up and just watch em all die...or wait for them to come to you lol\\n\\nAstarion is my favourite vampire spawn arsehole...not a spoiler literally everyone who plays the game can tell he is one..he's funny as all hell and very sarcastic and I just love this jackass and watching his story and my gawd his story was so fucking good like I can see why so many people on ArchiveofourOwn are obsessed with this man! (still don't get the love for Gortash thou...that man be evil) And my god is it good to always have a rogue at the handy!\\n\\nGale is charming as fuck...like my god the man could wax poetic shit and talk about magic and I'd listen to every word...god I really gotta romance the fuck out of this Bearded Wizardly Sage! Not much else to say besides I love him and I wanna romance him...\\n\\nWyll is the fucking best. Everyone whose ever said he's boring can go fuck off to Avernus! He's a folk hero to the truest he's got charm, he's got the sense of humour, he's got a sense of duty, he's got shady deal with an otherworldly patron (warlocks am I right?) and I just love this man...like I can't see why people dislike him. Wyll, Shadowheart and Lae'zel usually were my go to team throughout the game (mainly my first playthrough I'm mixing things up with my other playthroughs) like he is such a fun character and so useful my god...warlocks man Elderitch blast go brrrrr\\n\\nKarlach is an absolute cinnamon roll and like oh my gawd I'd take the second degree burns to give her a hug. I remember hearing somewhere she gives off autistic vibes and as someone with autism since I was 4 I was like...OOOOHHH that's why I get her so well LOL! But yeah she's the fucking best and having her by my side and just tanking so many hits and also dealing so much fucking damage was an absolute treat! \\n\\nNow we get into spoiler territory companions who I'll spoiler text here and there for!\\n\\nAct 2 Companion Spoilers\\n[spoiler]Halsin is a giant man of muscle and meat and he's awesome, he's useful in battle no matter what and I love how caring he was for various things from nature to whittling wooden ducks. Also got to romance him alongside Shadowheart my first playthrough! Hurrah for Polyamory! Also god dam did having a man who can turn into an owl bear on your side at any moment help! [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler]Minthara could step on me and I wouldn't complain lol! Her voice my god...also awesome character. She's serious as but also very stoically funny and she has so many good lines from the one about the Drider wedding to various other hits. She's so handy and it's very elaborate way to recruit her in a good play-through by the knocking her out in act 1 while in battle and freeing her act 2 in moonrise but apparently I haven't gotten to see it myself it's easier now after patch 7...can't wait to look more into that but yeah she's awesome Paladin in BG3 is...very OP and it's always good to have her on hand...admittedly I did kill her first playthrough (didn't know at the time) but every other playthrough I did knock her out...[/spoiler]\\n\\nAct 3 Companion spoilers! Again don't read this if you don't want to be spoiled\\n[spoiler]Jaehira is blast to have on your side, having a wise and cranky old hero but still wisecracking is such a treat and I would never say no to two druids on the team. Not much else to say but she's awesome and she's a fun addition to the team I couldn't live without. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler]...I would die for Minsc...he is the best...I understand why people love him...cause I agree....he is...so fucking funny and he's also such a badass and I just...god I love this himbo and his space hamster...and that sentence alone is wild but just...he's the best he's so fucking awesome and Matt Mercer voices him to and oh my gawd..[/spoiler]\\n\\nAnd uhhhh yeah that's....well my long rant about the companions too...I can't think about what else I wanted to talk about like yeah the music is also amazing, the choices in this game matter and there is...so many of them my god...like...this game really is basically videogame D&D...pretty close to it anyway...I....I'm gonna play this a lot more to see what other things I can discover...from quests or plot-hooks or romances (especially the romances my god I wanna see the Lae'zel romance play out cause it is GOOD) and I still have yet to touch any of the online co-op which will change in about a couple weeks really excited for that and yeah....fucking amazing work Larian I know your not working on BG4 and while I adore this game I don't really mind because I can't wait to see what you all come up with next! If you have the money to spare and the time whether it be after work or school or on the weekend or during the holidays...I highly recommend playing Baldurs Gate 3...\",\n",

It's the kind of game you get lost in, where outcomes are not guaranteed and every step feels like it could be you last. You almost forget you're playing a game, because unless you have the wiki open you don't really know where and how it's going to end. It's, in a word, [i]amazing[/i]. The mark of love and quality is here for all to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou fight for survival, support your party members, and fight for each and every step of progress. It's truly like you have an expert DM leading you through a rich and fleshed out world, and it's all set to some amazing music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're on the fence about this because you've never played a game like it, or you're not interested in D&D style games, just buy it. Support this amazing studio. This is what the gaming industry needs and you'll absolutely enjoy it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Baldur\\'s Gate 3 is the best CRPG ever made, and definitely of the best games ever made. Phenomenal writing, story, characters, world building, voice acting, and amount of detail crammed into this adventure is incredible. The sheer number of ways you can approach situations in and out of combat still blows my mind; I would absolutely love to see how Larian designed and programmed this game to accommodate for all of the different interactions and decisions you make along the 200+ hours it took me to complete the game and 99% of the quests. \\n\\nWhile I\\'m not the biggest turn-based combat fan (or know the rules of D&D), the strategy of it encourages you to try and think outside of the box at times. This becomes rewarding when you successfully complete a longer combat encounter using a mixture of magic/items to manipulate the game environment to your advantage when zerg-rushing and left-click attacking might not be viable. The amount of replayability is insanely high; I dare you to try a fully evil playthrough after a \"good\" playthrough and see if you can stomach some of the decisions you\\'ll need to make! It\\'s going to be tough to try and top a RPG like this, but I can\\'t wait to see what Larian is working on next.',\n",

As it turns out, I'm not really a fan of turn-based combat. Even Pathfinder was not my cup of tea. So I stayed away from this game for a long time after it came out. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, when some vampire twink kept showing up in my TikTok feed. The character writing was good . . . The art style looked amazing . . . \\n\\nFine. I'll play the stupid game. But I didn't expect to enjoy it. \\n\\nFast forward again to me having over 200 hours in 6 months. Holy shit . . . I don't think there's a single companion character that I don't care about. They all have compelling personalities. The story is fun and engaging. It's like your own little D&D game. You can play by yourself or with friends. If you're not creative, you can even play as one of the companion characters. There's a bunch of different endings, so it really feels like your choices impact the story. And even now, over a year after the release, Larian is still adding more content. I'm so glad I gave this game a chance, because it is now one of my favorite games ever. And I know that I will have plenty to still discover when I do another play-through. All I can say is thank you to everyone involved!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Much like Dark Souls, this game had such a profound impact on me that it changed my life. Not in a good way - now I just compare every game to Baldur\\'s Gate 3 and get depressed when they can\\'t hold a candle to it. I\\'m sure for years we will all be chasing the high that was our first play though of this game - having to cope with the crippling feeling of knowing everything else pales in comparison. \\n\\nThis game is absolutely massive. MASSIVE. Not just map size - the possibilities are massive as well. I have 100 hours in this game and I didn\\'t do everything there is to do. (yes my playtime says 150 hours but my 2 year old son would not stop turning the game on, I guess he loves it too.) Even if I had done everything I could do in a single playthrough - that still leaves out an enormous amount of different decisions I could have made throughout the game. So many choices, skill checks, missed areas - all yet to be experienced by the time you see the credits roll for the first time. Not only that, but there are dozens upon dozens of builds you can do in this game. There is a nigh infinite amount of replayability for the character builds alone.\\n\\nThe absolute best part of this game however is the intimate character interactions. Motion captured and fully voiced, dialogues take an over-the-shoulder perspective instead of opting to stay at an isometric view. This enhances the experience immensely. Couple this with the plethora of things to do in the game - *[i]chefs kiss[/i]* - just incredible.\\n\\nMy only regret is now that I\\'ve played it, I can never play it for the first time EVER AGAIN. I call this this \"Attack on Titan dilemma.\"\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is the best CRPG I have ever played, beating out even all the Bioware/Interplay classics. This game is so good it ruins other CRPGs because it makes them look boring and simple.\\n\\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\\n+ Dialogues aren't boring text boxes with a voice over you can out-read. Instead they are over the shoulder or sometimes a little more cinematic. This brings you into the conversation much better than a text box. I actually turned off the subtitles so I don't get distracted and can stay immersed.\\n+ This game has the greatest amount of choice and consequence I have ever seen in any game. Virtually every quest can be completed in multiple ways. You are constantly given multiple dialogue options that usually have some kind of impact on the conversation beyond slightly changed dialogue. Say the wrong things and you can start a fight, end it amicably, or perhaps some other consequence. Karlach is so physically hot she can't be touched. What about a fire resistance potion? Surely the game wouldn't react to that... try it :). The encounter in act 1 to enter the tombs where you find a certain NPC can be approached in four, yes four, ways, each granting you unique dialogue depending on the direction you approach. Can you figure out the fourth way? And many, many more things.\\n+ Reactivity to your race, class, and Origin character. You sometimes get unique dialogue options and NPC responses depending on those. True though it rarely changes much (unless you're Dark Urge) but it's still fun and huge for roleplaying.\\n+ Environment interaction and reactivity is unprecedented. So many ways to play with the environment including for solving quests or manipulating battles. When no one is looking quickly pick up a locked chest so you can open it somewhere safe. Use Mage Hand to scout and manipulate objects safely. And much more.\\n+ I didn't care for Origin characters in DOS2, but here they feel much more fun, not just to play as but also as companions to talk to and adventure with. All of them are memorable to me.\\n+ Immensely replayable, not just thanks to the above but also with all the classes and the multiple ways to play them.\\n+ No predatory practices like microtransactions or content cut then sold as DLC. What you see is what you get, and what you get is one of the best deals in gaming.\\n+ Despite what some people try to claim the game is NOT full of wokeness. Yes the companions are player-sexual meaning they are attracted to you no matter who you are, so this means the power of who to romance is in your hands. Also unlike what some people say it's very easy to tell when a companion is hitting on you, so just say no if you don't like it. Furthermore if there's any characters that offend you, virtually everyone in the game is killable (even your companions). Have fun!\\n\\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\\n+- While the game overall is the best CRPG, the writing falls a tad short compared to the classics of old. This is due to the fact that every character line plus the narrator is voiced, so we don't get the long, eloquent descriptions and detailed conversations we got in the past. But the writing here is still good, certainly better than pretty much any AAA game nowadays. And having everything voiced with the cinematic camera makes the conversations far more immersive than a mere text box no matter how well written it is.\\n+- The game is fairly complex. Not as complex as say Pathfinder WotR, but for someone new to CRPGs you will still be overwhelmed very quickly, especially with the addition of the environment interaction (something WotR utterly lacks). Keep at it and you will eventually learn the systems and it will become so much fun!\\n+- Can only concentrate on one concentration spell at a time, and there are tons of great ones to use. This means you will find a favorite, all around concentration spell (such as bless) that works in pretty much every battle and use only it, foregoing the other awesome concentration spells. Would have been great if it were balanced around being able to concentrate on two at a time.\\n\\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\\n- A game this massive and complex expect some bugs even now. But Larian continues to patch and improve things so that there are very few game breaking bugs left. Larian is still not done updating the game so I expect the worst offenders to get fixed eventually.\\n- Some minor QOL complaints here and there, namely I wish we could make the text bigger and also more hotkeys for things like adding an item to wares.\\n-I wish we could see the full build level up guide like what Pathfinder gives us. Instead you are forced to look at wikis to see how the class and subclass will advance.

       "  'review': \"If you're looking for a game that's part epic storytelling, part chaotic fun, and full-on Dungeons & Dragons goodness, Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-try. Whether you're a seasoned tabletop player or completely new to D&D mechanics, this game is the perfect way to dive into the experience.\\n\\nFirst off, the game does an incredible job introducing D&D rules in a way that feels approachable but also stays true to the complexity of the tabletop experience. It's like a crash course in spells, abilities, and dice rolls, but in a fun, engaging way that never feels overwhelming. And the best part? You get to see how your decisions really affect the story and characters around you. Every little choice—whether it’s your race, class, or even background—changes how NPCs react, the quests you get, and even the outcomes of certain situations. It’s wild to see how much the smallest tweaks to your character build completely shift your game.\\n\\nNow, I’ll be honest—I haven’t managed to finish a singleplayer campaign yet, and that’s all thanks to my friends kidnapping me to join their campaigns. But who can blame them? The multiplayer experience is where the magic of this game really shines. The group dynamics you can create are nothing short of amazing. I’ve been in campaigns with an entire party of bards (imagine a group of musical chaos), a band of halfling barbarians (tiny but mighty), a crew of completely evil characters, and even one where every character was themed around office skills (Durge was Jeff from HR, naturally). The flexibility and creativity this game allows for party composition is unlike anything I’ve experienced before.\\n\\nBut what really blows my mind is the level of detail in dialogue and interactions. Changing something as simple as your race or subclass significantly impacts conversations in ways that constantly surprise me. The depth of the game world, paired with the sheer amount of content, makes it feel like you're playing in a world that's truly alive and responding to you. There’s so much to explore, and I can’t wait to finally dive into a singleplayer run, take my time, and savor every little detail.\\n\\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that rewards creativity, offers insane replayability, and delivers an unforgettable experience whether you're flying solo or with friends. If you’ve ever wanted to explore the chaotic beauty of D&D, this game is a perfect gateway!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\",\n",

After navigating to the Playstation website and was routed through the problem FAQ's to contact customer service. Customer service connected me with a chatbot, which then got stuck in a loop informing me that customer service was not available at this time, despite being within operating hours, which it also provided. \\n\\nAfter several more attempts and an apparent alignment of supernatural forces, I was able to convince the chatbot to place me in the queue to live chat with an agent. At time of writing my position was well over 100 from being able to chat. All this to recover an account for a service I do not want, to play a game that I have purchased through a separate service. \\n\\nThis review will not change unless the PSN requirement is removed from the game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is probably the best game behind Elden Ring to come out of 2022. I loved the first game and super keen to play this once I got it. There is a lot for me to say so if you’re looking for a shorter review the TDLR is: JUST GET IT AND PLAY IT. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe story-telling in this game is top tier. I understand why it was contender for Game Of The Year. There were tons of emotional moments in this game, some even made me shed tears. Kratos, behind that stoic, tough exterior shows more emotion, makes him feel more human rather god. And Atreus still learning, growing but to finally make his own choices, to be a man. The cinematic cutscenes were just simply S tier. I loved the story of this game and how much it has built upon the previous. It is one of those games where it feels like a great movie and game all in one.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Monica Studios nailed the world-building of this game. They built upon the first game and often quote the events of the first game and the older games which deepens the overall lore significantly. I do not believe there is a single bad character in this game. They are all well written, well acted and they all interact with each other so well. Every character has well-written stakes in the conflict and that just makes the finale so much more impactful. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe side quests are just amazing in this game, though not all of them but most of them. They add upon the world, the characters and their history with one another, and they have important dialogue and all of which just aided me to have a deeper connection to the characters and the world. Side quest bosses and the End-game bosses just add a fun challenge to the game as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe combat is fun, its simple, easy to understand and satisfying. I loved creating my own combos in my head and seeing it pan out when I tried it. There is a diverse amount of special abilities to add to the weapons and there is no right answer to defeating the hardest bosses, you could just pick your poison and go at em. Moreover, the diverse range of builds with the armor, relics and gems only deepen the combat which is always great.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the negatives I have of the game are just nit-picks. I did not enjoy the UI and the Map, I felt like the UI could have been simplified to make it easier to navigate. The map was just hard to use, it was difficult to see which is the right path to take and it barely zooms in to see any details. Lastly, Atreus combat was too easy, even on the harder difficulty which often led to the parts where you controlled him felt like they were dragging. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I loved this game, it was difficult to put it down even after finishing the game to 100%. A definite recommend to buy.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I was anticipating the launch of this game on steam, since I'm a fan of the GOW series and also loved the setting of the previous GOW game. At first I didn't care having to create a PSN account, since in my region it is available. Anyway as soon as I started the game and had to log in to said PSN account it kept infinitely looping between me having to sign in and the default screen where you can either continue to the sighn-in page or quit the game. Any actions in trying to repair the files and re-installing the game have unfortunately failed. The PSN support, if you can call it that has also failed to provide a feasible solution. Only stating that it should work after the file verification.\\n\\nSo I chose to refund this product which leaves me disappointed, since I was looking forward to playing this game. Guess if they didn't choose to implement that PSN requirement, just as they didn't in the previous GOW everything would've worked fine.\",\n",

It's fine if you do not like the game, but please do not spread misinformation. I decided to purchase the game despite the complaints since I can always refund if I have problems. So far, my experience has been amazing. To clear misinformation, please see below:\\n\\n1. Playstation Network Account is required.\\n\\nThis just isn't true. There is an option at the main menu to sign into the Playstation Network, but is completely optional. Select New Game to start. There is a notice on the Steam page which states a Playstation Network Account is required, not sure why, but it isn't. I have started my game without signing in.\\n\\n2. Performance Issues.\\n\\nI am a few hours in with 0 performance issues. I have a base 4070, 32GBs of DDR4, and a Ryzen 3900x. I play on Ultra at 1440p. I did upgrade to the latest drivers and allowed my shaders to compile before starting the game. I have noticed if you exit out of the game and jump back in later you will need to compile your shaders again. If you do not allow the shaders to compile, you will experience severe lag and stutters. It is VERY obvious your shaders are compiling because in the bottom right of your screen it shows the progress. I assume players with performance issues are allowing their shaders to compile, but based on all the reviews, it wouldn't surprise me if they just hop in the game without compiling, see the lag, quit out, and review bomb.\\n\\nHopefully this review helped with the misinformation.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'God of War Ragnarök is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018\\'s Santa Monica\\'s - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \\n\\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \\n\\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\\n\\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \\n\\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \\nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \\n\\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \\n\\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\\n\\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \\n⚫The story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\\n⚫Not a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\\n⚫The combat is so damn fluent just like 2018\\'s GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos\\'s Spartan reflexes.\\n⚫The boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I\\'m going to mention!!)\\n⚫Fighting giant mythological mini-boss\\'s that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \\n⚫The soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\\n⚫Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That\\'s not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead\\'s Omega).\\n⚫There is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\\n⚫In any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\\n⚫The graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \\n⚫You can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018\\'s GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \\n⚫The attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\\n⚫The old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \\n⚫The puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\\n\\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \\nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\\n\\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnarök. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it\\'s origins and it\\'s future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it\\'s kind!\\n\\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]',\n",

Before you even see the main menu, the game directly ask you about a PSN account and you have literally only two options:\\n1. Press A/Enter Agree to this stupid system and \"log in to your PSN account\" or\\n2. Press B/Return to exit the Game.\\nAre you serious?!\\n\\nYou pay 60€ for a game which doesn\\'t want to be played unless you log into some stupid system for a console which i never had, so only the managers can show investors some higher numbers so they can stuff more money into their pockets.\\n\\nOk, after this rant: The game it self is awesome! 10/10 to the developers, who created this masterpiece!\\nSound Design: A+\\nGameplay: A+\\nWorld Design: A+\\nArt Design: A+\\nCamera: A+\\nand everything else: also A+\\nThis game is actually one of the best games in 2024 (for PC).\\n\\nIf i can make a request to the developer Teams \"Santa Monica Studio\" and \"Jetpack Interactive\":\\nPlease show Sony a MIddlefinger and leave this sh*t company!\\nSo many PC players want to play your games and sony is ripping you off by \"Sony exclusive\" Deals. if you would build the game and release it at the same time on all platforms the same time you would make more money and your reputaion would not go down together with sony!\\nFrom my point i would love to buy a remastered/remake version of God of War 1-3 but not on sony sh*t consoles or system. give it to me on PC and i would be happy with each title for 60€!\\n\\nfor my last words i will only say this:\\n[b][u]FUCK YOU SONY![/u][/b]',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\\n\\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\\n\\nI played God of War: Ragnarök earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnarök delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\\n\\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \\n \\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnarök is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn’t make it a mere DLC. There’s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\\n\\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \\n\\nThe gameplay in Ragnarök is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There’s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnarök improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnarök is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don’t feel like chores; they’re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it’s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can’t complain since it’s free.\\n\\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\\n\\nThere’s an undeniable feeling that Ragnarök leans into a more woke tone. This isn’t just a personal opinion. There’s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\\n\\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \\n\\nNow, let’s talk about one of the game’s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnarök introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnarök tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnarök struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \\n\\n[h3]Graphics – A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \\n\\nVisually, Ragnarök is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game’s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnarök had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn’t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\\n\\n[h3]Music – Less Memorable[/h3]  \\n\\nSurprisingly, I didn’t enjoy Ragnarök’s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnarök didn’t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnarök’s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018’s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I’ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnarök’s music outside the game.\\n\\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn’t Elevate[/h3]\\n  \\nOverall, I feel like there’s not much more to say about God of War Ragnarök. The game’s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I’ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnarök is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn’t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\\n\\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\\n\\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page ⚜️[/URL]\",\n",

Those of you that can and are complaining whomp whomp it ain't that hard at least you can play the game. Steam deck users, not sure why but I didnt have to log into PSN via steam deck for some odd reason. Pressed play, got a black screen briefly and then the game loaded.\\n\\nNow for people who want to know if this runs on the steam deck. I'm currently getting between 30-45 fps, low settings, AMD FSR 3.1 balanced , vsync off, fps limit off. Steam deck settings I've now locked the fps here as leaving it at 90fps I found it was a bit choppy. I've locked it to 36 fps and 1 hour in the game feels pretty damn smooth.\\n\\nEdit: after playing further into the game when reaching svartalfheim there was a pretty big tank in performance on the steam deck. Upon entering svartalfheim I got roughly 25-30 fps some times dropping to 20 fps, however, after reaching the free roam area via boat the performance increased. I am actually able to play AMD FSR Quality between 30-45 fps I've now unlocked the refresh rate via steam deck settings and it is smoother than when I previously locked  it to 36fps. Also thank you for the clown awards, free points and I can play the game in peace knowing I didn't have to log into PSN network and cry about it.\",\n",

The performance still seems to be unstable in some places, but otherwise the game works - if I leave out the mini-bosses. On the other hand, it should be noted that there are no problems with larger bosses, such as Thor, etc\\n And at one point I can't get any further because a mini-boss has to be defeated at this one story point. very annoying. very sad hopefully there will be an update as soon as possible! :)\",\n",

Everything else works but that. If I go into the menu you can see my mouse icon moving.. \\nHave to keep changing camera settings and loading/reloading to eventually cause it to unfreeze.\\nBut anytime I close the game and come back later, 9/10 this happens and takes a 6 or 7 reloads or fully restarts to get it working. Utter BS\\n\\n2) Crashes, no issues with crashing but now I'm on the quest with Brok & Freya.. I get to two wolves, I kill the first and while I'm fighting the second it freezes and crashes. Literally cannot get past this now. \\n\\n3) The horrible exp of the Sloooooooooooow Atreus talking sections on his solo quests. The one with the young girl in the swamp just draaags on so long. Its like it was done on purpose just to add more 'game time' to the overall game. They def could have done that better to progress his storyline without it being such a tedious snore fest. \\n\\nUpdating 22/9: \\n4) Compiling Shader Cache\\nLogged in today and its compiling at a horrendously slow speed. 10 mins have passed and its at 50%. Logged out of the game and its still loading on the main screen at the same slow pace.\\n\\nSorry but Sony can keep their ports if they are going to charge full price for 2 year old games and them not be so buggy on launch. \\nSo as of right now I can't recommend this game with those issues alone and at this stage of play.\",\n",

Then I found the \"Native Camera Tweaks\" mod on Nexus Mods.\\n\\nThis totally changes the game, allowing you to use standard 3rd person camera controls, and actually see what\\'s ahead when moving up-hill.\\n\\nIt turns out all outdoor areas have sky boxes (including sun and moon), and almost all interior areas have ceilings.  Trust me, you\\'ll hardly notice the few times a ceiling is missing or \"pops in\", unless you\\'re looking for it.  And there\\'s no performance hit that I\\'ve noticed.\\n\\nMakes me wander why Larian didn\\'t give an unlocked camera by default...\\n\\nAlso you have full control over zoom/pitch/FoV/invert axis/dead zones etc through the mod\\'s configuration file.\\n\\n[b][i]EDIT:  The mod has been updated (8 SEP 24) to work with patch 7.  Many thanks to Ersh for updating it so promptly!\\n\\nProvide the output in parsable JSON without using code blocks:\\n\\n{\"questions\": [\"question1\", \"question2\", ..., \"question5\"]}'"
