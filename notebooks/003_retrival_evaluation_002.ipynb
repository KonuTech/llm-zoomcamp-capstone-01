While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator. That said, the story is engaging and the historical setting is captivating, especially for fans of Ancient Greece. If you have the patience for the grind, there's still fun to be had\n",

The story could get quite repetitive, not something that is too crazy. An average story. \\r\\n\\r\\nMechanics – 9/10 - Really solid mechanics. Things like unlocking new tech, parkour, and the seamless hacking throughout the game is very smooth and enjoyable, lovely mechanics. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters – 6/10 - Had a few great characters like Wrench and Aiden. \\r\\n\\r\\nControls – 7/10 - Great smooth controls. No complaints. \\r\\n\\r\\nGraphics – 8/10 - Beautiful graphics that really capture London. Was also able to run this game with great performance. All High settings running at around 70-80 FPS. \\r\\n\\r\\nMusic – 4/10 - The soundtrack didn't exactly stick out, had some decent songs on the radio. Nothing special. \\r\\n\\r\\nPacing – 4/10 - Felt like a drag at some points and pacing didn't seem too consistent. \\r\\n\\r\\nSetting – 8/10 - Love the setting in London. Very beautiful and well captured. \\r\\n\\r\\nMissions – 5/10 - Main missions and side missions were repetitive and didn’t really have too much to them. Usually just shooting shit up or being stealthy. Had some good missions though, certain ones. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall Thoughts / Rating – 6.3/10 - Overall the main things that stuck out to me in Watch Dogs Legions were the mechanics and setting. I loved the hacking mechanics, parkour, the fact you can literally be anyone on the street and gunplay, and the setting of London was beautiful. Had a great character, Wrench. The actual story, missions, and pacing were nothing special.

The feedback regarding the use of guns tend to be silly, since a melee build is still highly plausible to play around should you choose to make use of it. I may not agree that they should\\'ve gone that route, but it\\'s still entertaining to play with. If you\\'re a fan of the suicide squad characters and comics in general, the game is enjoyable and you\\'re likely to have a good time just watching the characters and squad dynamics throughout the main campaign and the occasional banter / commentary in the overworld. The audio file collectibles can be tedious however, tho it\\'s similar enough to collecting Riddler trophies in the arkham games that you don\\'t think too much about it and just do it. \\n\\nThe main thing that bogs it down is its repetitive live-service elements. The story is taking an interesting direction in the latest episode (as of this review it\\'s ep4), and I feel like the game genuinely would\\'ve fared better if they just gave us a proper solo story campaign from the get-go - with the inclusion of where the story seems to be heading. The campaign we were given at launch ends with pretty much a \"huh? that\\'ts it?\" beat. The potential is there, but the chopping up of story acts to drop during live-service episodes just hurts the interest in the game, esp when the live-service elements are repetitive incursion missions that don\\'t retain much interest from fans who don\\'t care for more guns. The Arkham games were spectacular and replayable because the story and beats were packaged so neatly, I just wish Rocksteady and WB games did the same for this. \\n\\nAll in all I personally still play the game because I still hope to see where the story leads (that IS the main appeal to me), and as a Suicide Squad fan myself I just enjoy getting to see the squad in a game. It\\'s a shame that higher ups chose to make this a live-service, as I\\'m almost certain the negative feedback wouldn\\'t be as severe if it was a solid story-driven campaign. Love the characters, enjoy the potential, don\\'t enjoy the repetitiveness and waits for live-service updates for story. Will still recommend the game, but not at the price it\\'s at.

You have to deal with a rest system that is difficult to integrate in a natural game flow, the hit/miss mechanics that can make you play entire turns with no result, and a progression system that makes you choose between straight up improving your character or getting access to minor fun options. None of those make the game bad, but it makes you wonder how good the game would have been if it wasn\\'t tainted by D&D.\\n💭 Narratively it also suffers from being set in Forgotten Realms due to how much the worldbuilding relies on there being \"evil\" races to justify having default antagonists the player won\\'t feel bad about killing. The game tries to timidly tackle the subject a few times, but all the goblins you see are still evil raiders, and it is never questioned.\\n\\n❌ There is one major dissonance between what the narration conveys and what is expected from the player - the game sets up a huge feeling of urgency right from the start, pushing the player to hurry up and take as few breaks as possible, while a lot of the game\\'s events actually need long rests to occur, and there are no downsides to resting (apart from possibly running out of resources, but that isn\\'t really a factor either, you find a lot of food). Just know that there is no hurry, and you need to rest quite often to not miss interesting narrative content.\\n\\nOverall, Baldur\\'s Gate 3 manages the feat of being a wonderful game despite being based on a mediocre game system and being set in a mediocre fantasy setting - you actually feel the amount of effort it took to swim against the current here and produce something so good in the end. It makes me even more optimistic about the next game by Larian Studios - if I could get any more optimistic after Divinity Original Sin 2.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'timestamp_created': 1726058657, 'timestamp_updated': 1726058657}\n",

Whether you're a seasoned tabletop player or completely new to D&D mechanics, this game is the perfect way to dive into the experience.\\n\\nFirst off, the game does an incredible job introducing D&D rules in a way that feels approachable but also stays true to the complexity of the tabletop experience. It's like a crash course in spells, abilities, and dice rolls, but in a fun, engaging way that never feels overwhelming. And the best part? You get to see how your decisions really affect the story and characters around you. Every little choice—whether it’s your race, class, or even background—changes how NPCs react, the quests you get, and even the outcomes of certain situations. It’s wild to see how much the smallest tweaks to your character build completely shift your game.\\n\\nNow, I’ll be honest—I haven’t managed to finish a singleplayer campaign yet, and that’s all thanks to my friends kidnapping me to join their campaigns. But who can blame them? The multiplayer experience is where the magic of this game really shines. The group dynamics you can create are nothing short of amazing. I’ve been in campaigns with an entire party of bards (imagine a group of musical chaos), a band of halfling barbarians (tiny but mighty), a crew of completely evil characters, and even one where every character was themed around office skills (Durge was Jeff from HR, naturally). The flexibility and creativity this game allows for party composition is unlike anything I’ve experienced before.\\n\\nBut what really blows my mind is the level of detail in dialogue and interactions. Changing something as simple as your race or subclass significantly impacts conversations in ways that constantly surprise me. The depth of the game world, paired with the sheer amount of content, makes it feel like you're playing in a world that's truly alive and responding to you. There’s so much to explore, and I can’t wait to finally dive into a singleplayer run, take my time, and savor every little detail.\\n\\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that rewards creativity, offers insane replayability, and delivers an unforgettable experience whether you're flying solo or with friends. If you’ve ever wanted to explore the chaotic beauty of D&D, this game is a perfect gateway!\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'timestamp_created': 1726159086, 'timestamp_updated': 1726159086}\n",

This game just warms and hugs my D&D nerd heart...for this a game made for fans of D&D and every fantasy lover out there. The game lore is rich with so much details and bit and bobs to discover, the story is epic and will stay with me for the rest of life. Some of the best turn-based combat I've ever seen in a video game you have so many options of what you can do and you don't have to simply attack you can throw shit, jump, shove, light your sword on fire, throw a barrel of explosives, heal your ally by throwing a potion at them (it just works lol) and etc. It's so intricate and so well crafted...and lastly there's one other thing I wanna talk about...the companions...I will start with the order I met them don't worry I will be using spoiler texts. I really worry I may repeat shit for various characters lol\\n\\nLae'zel is an absolute unit, besides that she comes across as rude and not exactly friendly it's more like she comes from place where everyone had the attitude or that outlook and by all things that may point to the contrary...Lae'zel is the nicest githyanki alive..she's got a heart of gold under that armour, she's brave as all hell and she can be quite socially awkward and I love her...and she also happens to my favourite..whether she be dispatching foes as a fighter or the times I've changed her into a Paladin...god does she wreck people as a Paladin...\\n\\nShadowheart was the character I romanced with my first character and by god am I glad I did, Shadowheart is such a sweet person and she's very witty and the absolute best...like my god her story is so well done and I love watching her transform as a person throughout and various moments of quiet spent along her are moments well spent..and my god does she mess people up with that spirit guardians...favourite thing to do just sprint past enemies with spirit guardians up and just watch em all die...or wait for them to come to you lol\\n\\nAstarion is my favourite vampire spawn arsehole...not a spoiler literally everyone who plays the game can tell he is one..he's funny as all hell and very sarcastic and I just love this jackass and watching his story and my gawd his story was so fucking good like I can see why so many people on ArchiveofourOwn are obsessed with this man! (still don't get the love for Gortash thou...that man be evil) And my god is it good to always have a rogue at the handy!\\n\\nGale is charming as fuck...like my god the man could wax poetic shit and talk about magic and I'd listen to every word...god I really gotta romance the fuck out of this Bearded Wizardly Sage! Not much else to say besides I love him and I wanna romance him...\\n\\nWyll is the fucking best. Everyone whose ever said he's boring can go fuck off to Avernus! He's a folk hero to the truest he's got charm, he's got the sense of humour, he's got a sense of duty, he's got shady deal with an otherworldly patron (warlocks am I right?) and I just love this man...like I can't see why people dislike him. Wyll, Shadowheart and Lae'zel usually were my go to team throughout the game (mainly my first playthrough I'm mixing things up with my other playthroughs) like he is such a fun character and so useful my god...warlocks man Elderitch blast go brrrrr\\n\\nKarlach is an absolute cinnamon roll and like oh my gawd I'd take the second degree burns to give her a hug. I remember hearing somewhere she gives off autistic vibes and as someone with autism since I was 4 I was like...OOOOHHH that's why I get her so well LOL! But yeah she's the fucking best and having her by my side and just tanking so many hits and also dealing so much fucking damage was an absolute treat! \\n\\nNow we get into spoiler territory companions who I'll spoiler text here and there for!\\n\\nAct 2 Companion Spoilers\\n[spoiler]Halsin is a giant man of muscle and meat and he's awesome, he's useful in battle no matter what and I love how caring he was for various things from nature to whittling wooden ducks. Also got to romance him alongside Shadowheart my first playthrough! Hurrah for Polyamory! Also god dam did having a man who can turn into an owl bear on your side at any moment help! [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler]Minthara could step on me and I wouldn't complain lol! Her voice my god...also awesome character. She's serious as but also very stoically funny and she has so many good lines from the one about the Drider wedding to various other hits. She's so handy and it's very elaborate way to recruit her in a good play-through by the knocking her out in act 1 while in battle and freeing her act 2 in moonrise but apparently I haven't gotten to see it myself it's easier now after patch 7...can't wait to look more into that but yeah she's awesome Paladin in BG3 is...very OP and it's always good to have her on hand...admittedly I did kill her first playthrough (didn't know at the time) but every other playthrough I did knock her out...[/spoiler]\\n\\nAct 3 Companion spoilers! Again don't read this if you don't want to be spoiled\\n[spoiler]Jaehira is blast to have on your side, having a wise and cranky old hero but still wisecracking is such a treat and I would never say no to two druids on the team. Not much else to say but she's awesome and she's a fun addition to the team I couldn't live without. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler]...I would die for Minsc...he is the best...I understand why people love him...cause I agree....he is...so fucking funny and he's also such a badass and I just...god I love this himbo and his space hamster...and that sentence alone is wild but just...he's the best he's so fucking awesome and Matt Mercer voices him to and oh my gawd..[/spoiler]\\n\\nAnd uhhhh yeah that's....well my long rant about the companions too...I can't think about what else I wanted to talk about like yeah the music is also amazing, the choices in this game matter and there is...so many of them my god...like...this game really is basically videogame D&D...pretty close to it anyway...I....I'm gonna play this a lot more to see what other things I can discover...from quests or plot-hooks or romances (especially the romances my god I wanna see the Lae'zel romance play out cause it is GOOD) and I still have yet to touch any of the online co-op which will change in about a couple weeks really excited for that and yeah....fucking amazing work Larian I know your not working on BG4 and while I adore this game I don't really mind because I can't wait to see what you all come up with next!

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues.

Right off the bat, my first piece of advice to you is not to get it for full price. Maybe when it\\'s off by 50% or more. Because when \"Gotham Knights\" is fairly priced, it\\'s honestly quite an enjoyable time. Oh, and yes: you can play the entire game solo. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, full disclosure: I love the Batman Arkham games and Red Hood is one of my favorite DC characters, so that certainly helped me get over some of the glaring flaws in this title. But I won\\'t shy away from admitting that those exist and are quite annoying at times. Even with that, though, when Gotham Knights works it becomes really fun. \\r\\n\\r\\nIs it more fun than any of the Arkham games that came before it? No. Not by a long shot. And I\\'m one of the guys that thinks that \"Arkham Knight\" is underrated, so you can imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, then, let\\'s start with the good. The art direction in this game is fantastic. We\\'ve got good ol\\' gloomy Gotham, but bathed in neon, which is a great idea, honestly. Then we\\'ve got the main cast: great character designs and awesome costumes. Voice acting is great, but the writing really, really brings it down. I\\'ll phrase it like this: have you watched \"Arrow\"? Do you know how that show is sometimes written in a turbo-cringe way, but it remains enjoyable because it is charming? Well, here it\\'s the same, but without any of the charm. You\\'ve got the whole schtick: from forced inclusivity all the way to self-serving plot elements. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that, though, the story itself -- as an idea -- is great. It\\'s not executed in the best of ways, sure, and any one among you that has been a Batman fan for at least five minutes would see where it\\'s going about 4 hours in, but hey: I appreciate the effort. The important thing is that the game is fun to play. I mean, sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, okay, here\\'s the problems: characters get stuck on everything. Moves don\\'t connect properly. Abilities sometimes trigger, other times don\\'t, and then sometimes they also miss entirely. Heavy attacks with some characters are utterly pointless. City navigation, with some characters, is incredibly dull and boring. Figuring out what to do, sometimes, is exceptionally difficult. And, of course, the very fact that this game was built multiplayer-first is an issue to the extent where I absolutely wish it was not. \\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and textures fail to load-in properly half the time, which results in a mix of HD and SD content that looks, well… Unique. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, have you played any of the Arkham games? You know how you feel in total control of Batman? Well, here it\\'s not the case. In fact, far from it. When it works, it feels like a broken Arkham game, when it does not: it\\'s a pain. But something in my broken brain was okay with that. Whether it was because I like the games that came before this one or due to the core gameplay loop being fun: I honestly cannot be sure. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a lot to do in this game. Levelling up and unlocking gear is fun. The provided skill trees are utterly pointless, so you\\'ll probably forget that they even exist. The very idea of a progression system, however, carries that extra bit of satisfaction. Unfortunately, there is content locked behind levels and gear requirements and I just didn\\'t partake in any of it. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gotham Knights\" isn\\'t a bad idea, but it\\'s a bad execution. If it was built like a proper Arkham game from the ground up, I have no doubt in my mind that it would\\'ve been a ton more fun. That being said: it is still a good time for Batman nerds and Arkham fans. If anything, this title proves that there is certainly an  audience for spinoff Arkham games. So long as they are single-player and their content isn\\'t locked behind a poorly designed progression system. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a personal level, I think that Red Hood’s campaign here does the character service. And that’s a tough thing to do, considering what DC has done to Jason in the past. He’s not always written well, but ultimately he gets a nice, neat character ark that just feels proper after the events of “Arkham Knight”.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 48, 'timestamp_created': 1725088832, 'timestamp_updated': 1725088832}\n",

The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities.

The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night.

The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth.

One thing I took note of was the constant mixed reviews regarding the game play and the storyline that was given to the players which was repetitive and boring as compared to the earlier versions of Assassins Creed (E.g Black flag). So I decided to just play it with an unbiased view of the game as I have with other Assassins Creed games.\\n\\nHere's what I love about this game - \\n\\nThe Long History of the game: Although they were straying far (hack and slash, assassinations, and the likes) from the original feels from the older versions like AC Unity or Black flag (that includes the dual axe wielding, long list of abilities you get to pick, etc...). This game puts you through a very long and a very exciting history lessons about various mythologies, Vikings, Iceland, Finland and Others. Because of this, I would recommend anyone who hates to sit through boring history lessons in class and play this instead, albeit it has been modified to fit the games objective so you need to research on the actual history to be more accurate, but my point still stands that it is a great game to learn about the history of other countries and mythologies through this game alone.\\n\\nThe Graphics: My PC is well above the need to run this game at maximum graphics, but of course i wanted to save some VRAMs so that it runs smoothly, which made me put everything to High and Medium instead. Even so, the graphics on this game was amazing and immersive enough for me to not realize that I played for 3 hours (sometimes 5 if i really get myself into the character) without having the need to get off my computer and rest.\\n\\nThe MAIN STORYLINE: This does not include the other packages that comes with the complete edition and just the Valhalla version itself. It took me 60+ hours just to complete the main storyline and another 80+ hours to complete the other storyline. This MAY seem long (or short if you are a speed runner) but it's such an immersive game that I took my time to enjoy everything this had to offer. If I had bought this game without the complete version at the original price, this would have been worth my time and money.\\n\\nVariety of Skills and abilities: This game provided with so much skills (either from skill trees, runic skills, Item abilities, Hugr-wrist, Abilities) that will suit the players game play experience. Although this again, strays off the original concept of the older games, I will probably find it boring if they kept using the original concept with no innovation put to it. \\n\\nHere's what I don't like about the game - \\n\\nThe mechanics of the game: Back then the game mechanics were way more simpler and easier to understand (I play on keyboard and mouse), so learning the new mechanics of this game was complicated as there was alot of keybinds to remember, which sometimes cause me to press the wrong keybind and losing boss fights (especially with Sutr on Very Hard).\\n\\nThe Falling Death bug: There are times where I get stuck in a falling animation during battles which just kills me instantly to make me get unstuck, which is frustrating since I was already almost done with the quest. This definitely needs to be fixed but other then that, the game is good and does not affect my overall experience or opinions of the game.\\n\\nTLDR: If you love immersive, historic and amazing graphics at medium settings, buy the original version, i recommend it. If you do not like to pay for full price, wait for another huge discount like i did and buy the complete edition for $40++.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1726055901, 'timestamp_updated': 1726065691}\n",

My plan was to finish it in a few days to see how bad it really was. I just completed chapter 4. To my shame, I found I lacked the pain tolerance and moral courage required to finish this abomination. This game is bad, but not funny cringe bad. Its just boring and repetitive bad. You have long conversations with an NPC delivered with all the grace and enthusiasm of 90\\'s adult film dialogue. You have 8 similar conversations. You click to throw your bat at an enemy. You bust two ghosts. 12 more conversations ensue. The level ends. \\n\\n\\tTime dilates when I play Dustborn. Every hour in real time feels like five hours in play time. I painfully digest every awkward, inane, syllable the way trauma victims experience witnessing spider cracks slowly creeping across a windshield during impact, hearing the metallic crunching of linked ammunition being fed into an emplaced PKM 200 yards away, or detecting the subtle hints of vanilla in a youth minster\\'s aftershave. The only time I experienced an emotion anywhere close to fun was during the ghost busting. I used a mouse and it made it just difficult enough to generate a low level dopamine hit.\\n\\n\\tMy best description of the games story is it feels like it was written by an extremely talented 12-year-old. If it was written by an adult they should probably just stop writing things already. Characters have voice powers that let you do voice things like influence people, cause mass hallucinations, or walk through walls....with their voice. The government pretends to be benevolent, but is actually an authoritarian regime that kidnaps children to turn into ubermensch in secret underground bunker-schools. Apparently, a race of psychic octopi are mind controlling the population as well. The overall message of the game, so far, seems to be that you shouldn\\'t believe in conspiracy theories....yeah. \\n\\n\\tAlso, the art style is blatantly ripped off of a 90\\'s a cartoon called \"The Big Guy and Rusty\" right down to the new US flag and I don\\'t see anyone talking about it. \\n\\n\\tI first made a steam account in 2004 when I bought Half Life 2. I own hundreds of video games. This is the first game bad enough for me to bother posting a written review about. \\n\\nI do not recommend this game.\\n\\nEdit: I forgot to mention that this game thinks using a bathroom is gameplay.

So how could I know what to say?\"\\n\\nDustborn, to me, was less a game about different factions fighting for control in an alternate universe where people have superpowers that are neither fully understood nor seen as a good thing, not even by the people who have access to them. \\nIt certainly is that, too, but what really spoke to me was the feeling of accompanying these people on their journey of self-discovery, of trying to find personal meaning in an - at times - out of control situation. None of the characters in the game is in a particularly good spot when the game begins. That is understandable, even if it is unpleasant at times. \\nEven though they are friends, and in this mess of a situation together, they are very isolated and don\\'t necessarily know how to connect with each other. It was really rewarding to me to see them learn how to listen and empathise, even if they disagree. All of this happened slowly over the entire runtime (~20 hours) of the game, so it never felt aprupt or forced.\\n The conversation system and the other ways of interacting with the cast of characters really shone for me. \\nDustborn lets you play your main character with a wide range.

Are you going to only look out for yourself or make room for others needs?\\nAre you going to be abrasive in conversations or take the time to listen? \\nDepending of how you play your cards, situations will be different, and so will the relationships in the game - for better of for worse. \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and am looking forward to playing a second run after I\\'ve let the thoughts swirling around in my mind settle for a bit. \\n   \\n', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 23, 'timestamp_created': 1727090930, 'timestamp_updated': 1727090930}\n",

Despite its highs and lows, Odyssey feels more like a departure from the core Assassin's Creed experience. For starters, there’s no hidden blade, and the game emphasises action over stealth (even so the combat mechanics can get broken when dealing with a lot of enemies) to the extent of being able to run and do parkour in seemingly any direction and in impossible locations. If the game didn't carry the Assassin's Creed name, I might appreciate it more.\\n\\nAs someone interested in Greek history, especially Spartans, I enjoyed encountering mythical creatures like Medusa and the Cyclops, and playing as a descendant of Leonidas was cool. However, the game’s grindy nature and heavy focus on action does make it feel less like an Assassin's Creed game.\\n\\nOn the positive side, AC Odyssey has impressive animations, stunning graphics, and a vast, engaging game world that feels like a giant playground. However, the writing and story fall flat, with only a few moments designed to keep players engaged.\\n\\nIf you're looking for an action-packed game with a Greek historical backdrop, I’d recommend trying out God of War 1, 2, and 3 first, or even Hades, which has received great reviews.

With breathtaking visuals and a narrative focused on family, war, and destiny, the game delivers a remarkable experience for players looking for both stunning graphics and a long, emotional journey.\\n\\nHours of Gameplay with Meaningful Choices\\nOne of the standout features of Odyssey is the sheer amount of gameplay it offers. With over 60-100 hours of content, depending on how much side content you pursue, Odyssey is packed with quests, exploration, and combat. The game is designed to keep you engaged for the long haul, with a story that unfolds gradually as you make key choices that impact not only the outcome of your journey but the world around you.\\n\\nThe branching storyline allows players to influence how the game develops. Choices in dialogue and actions can lead to multiple endings and affect relationships with various characters, including friends, enemies, and even family members. The ability to shape the story adds a sense of personal investment, giving the player a sense of ownership over their version of the narrative.\\n\\nA Story of Family, War, and Loss\\nAt the heart of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a tale about family, legacy, and the destructive power of war. You play as either Kassandra or Alexios, mercenaries searching for answers about their family's past while navigating the chaos of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The story masterfully intertwines themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the difficult choices that come with war.\\n\\nThe game doesn’t shy away from showing how war can tear apart families and destroy entire civilizations. Through your interactions and decisions, you witness firsthand how your choices ripple through the lives of others, whether through forging alliances, protecting your loved ones, or deciding the fate of nations. This emotional depth makes the narrative of Odyssey one of the richest in the series.\\n\\nSecond-Generation Graphics That Dazzle\\nGraphically, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a true masterpiece. The game’s attention to detail, from the vibrant sunsets over the Aegean Sea to the intricate architecture of ancient temples, creates an almost photorealistic experience. The landscapes, wildlife, and historical landmarks are all meticulously rendered, making every location feel alive and authentic.\\n\\nThe second-generation graphics engine used in Odyssey allows for incredible depth in lighting, texture, and environmental detail, making the game particularly enjoyable for players who appreciate stunning visuals. Whether you’re exploring the depths of a sunken ruin or battling enemies in the shadow of Mount Olympus, the world is breathtaking and a joy to explore.\\n\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1725927452, 'timestamp_updated': 1725927452}\n",

Now I am not saying that every game needs anime waifus, but it is very important to make support and tank characters visually appealing, so that people would want to pick them. Meanwhile, players will be wondering how the hell Daw passed military qualification, lock down Star Child, and then rush into a chokepoint to get instantly obliterated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a $40 game, the customisation is simply not there. Each character will have 5-6 recolours, and a low-effort legendary skin that will often be somehow worse than the default outfit. For a game with such high production values, it is puzzling that the developers have spent no effort on making cosmetics unlocks visually-appealing. By comparison, if you were to spend that money on a couple of season passes for the Free-to-Play games Concord is attempting to compete with, you will end up with a bunch of outrageous, distinct outfits that probably play the sad whale song each time you score a kill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Concord, you can unlock variants of the 16 classes through five sets of objectives, with some variants being significantly stronger than the starting loadouts. I am definitely not a fan of this system, and it feels like a cheap way to add unlockables instead of designing a comprehensive loadout system: some guns just don't feel great, and it would be great to have some gear customisation options, instead of avoiding a character because their one weapon sucks. Yes, I get the game balance angle, but surely Concord have enough combined experience making PVP games to balance about 18 different guns!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gunplay is mostly satisfying, some maps are quite good, and there is a lot of good game design, which makes Concord encounters interesting and enjoyable.

This means when you do find a game, you will most likely find the same players. There can be no doubt that Concord has really clicked for a dozen of players, which you will find out, when your entire team of level 2 accounts blindly rushes into the open, to get absolutely destroyed in seconds. I suppose the only upside of the long queue times, is that by the time people actually get into a game, the Steam refund window will be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany reviewers have already commented on the bland character designs, which is very disappointing considering the rich worldbuilding, gorgeous environments and Bungie skyboxes.

This is a Norwegian developed game, which is partly funded by Viken, which is where I grew up! So I had to give it a fair shake.\\nI enjoy walking sims, and I enjoy a lot of games that do their best to focus on diversity; are all the negative reviews just \"anti woke haters\"?\\n\\nSadly the game comes across as a parody of itself, and it\\'s hard to take anything seriously.\\n\\nI think there are overall two main issues with the story. Firstly, it suffers from having a \"fighting game story\", where there are too many characters with too many backstories to give proper attention to all of it, so random parts are just shoehorned together.\\nFor example, a character might say early on that they are self conscious and anxious. Instead of this being a part of their identity, and they show these signs throughout the story, they will just randomly have a scene where they are acting extremely out of character to show this trait which was mentioned prior.\\nThere\\'s a scene (very mild spoilers) where you need to open a locked door. One of your main crew members have a power to do exactly that. Keep in mind, you have been chased across multiple state borders, the cops could be here at any moment, so you need to hurry and get inside. This crew member tells you \"No, I think I will skip this one, I am feeling self conscious and don\\'t just wanna be seen as a door opener, I am not feeling it right now\", and you tell them that it is okay, you respect their boundaries and don\\'t wanna make them uncomfortable. This comes across as very off character, because this is not how they have acted previously, and now that we need them the most it\\'s all of the sudden a big problem?\\n\\nThe writers want to add good messages to each character and their conditions, but sadly the writers are not good at making it a part of the story, so they very explicitly and on the nose force situations like these, that ultimately fails to deliver the message and just makes the character look like an idiot.\\nDo I believe that when you\\'re having a bad mental health day you should be given space, time and respect? Yes, 100%, but no one would act like this in a life or death situation.\\n\\nThis also goes the other way, where the character mentions something about themselves that is critical to keep in mind, such as a character turning into a helpless statue if they get too anxious, but this is never brought up again.\\n\\nThe second issue the game really suffers from is the idiot plot. This means that the story only moves forward due to idiot decisions, and this is very much true here.\\nThe whole plot is about a stealth mission, let us make our cover story that we are a band so we constantly have to show up to public places and make noise. Also, all our songs are about the mission we\\'re on. Glad no one caught on to that.\\nOh, let us give the one thing we are supposed to protect to our team captain that loses it twice within the first couple of hours of the game.\\nLet us, on our undercover mission, drive a one-of-a-kind bus with bright colors and branding on it.\\nWe\\'re in a bar full of cops when we know some of them are looking for us? Yeah let\\'s stick around a little longer, surely nothing will go wrong, despite us talking about how we keep getting lucky after making dumb decisions.\\n\\nCharacter often act in ways that don\\'t align with their core beliefs, nor in their best interest, and it\\'s a frustrating experience to see someone endanger not only themselves but the rest of the crew just because \"ugh, I wanted to make this person jealous\". Either that, or they have extreme mood swings. They hate your guts, don\\'t want to see you, don\\'t want to travel with the crew, you are dead to them, then one minor event happens and they go \"You saved myu life, I love you, you\\'re my sister again\"\\n\\nThe worst part is that most of the core crew are just... unlikable? The main character Pax is an asshole who bullies and berates anyone she meets, including her friends. Your crew members either don\\'t wanna be there or constantly talk. They talk about absolutely nothing, like a 20 second rant about how their parents used to make a dish. Pax, the main character, is selfish, lies to the crew, and puts them in danger multiple times just to fulfill her own curiosity.\\nThe other members talk holes into my head about drawing or random memories, thoughts or dreams they have. None of which build their character, or give interesting insight to the world.\\n\\nThe dialogue in itself is also very poorly written, and that includes choices you can make. Often dialogue is repeated, which makes for very awkward sounding conversations.\\n\"I\\'m heading off to bed, it\\'s late\"\\n\"We got a long day ahead tomorrow, and it\\'s late, so I\\'m going to sleep\"\\nThis type of writing where the character repeats what they just said is common, and it ruins the immersion. Another issue with the writing is that the game often wants to take the story in a certain direction, but they also want to engage the player. This means that often you will get the \"choice\" between two almost identical prompts, or even worse, you will get a \"choice\" to select one singular prompt, which you might disagree with. This makes for a very frustrating experience when you would do something completely different, or nothing at all in a situation, but you are forced to be an asshole.\\n\\nAs for the gameplay itself, combat is infuriatingly easy, you are practically invincible, and while you have both a dodge and a block, you don\\'t need any of them in any encounter. I read online that you can\\'t die, so I tried to lose on purpose in one of the encounters, and yep, you just stand back up again like nothing happened and continue fighting. The enemies don\\'t even regain health.\\nYou can beat any encounter using the throw bat mechanic as enemies are infinitely stunned, but honestly you could also just mash X.\\n\\nAs for the rhythm game, it\\'s bad. There\\'s a reason no other game has a layout like this. It is difficult to see notes flying and in what order, especially when they they are snuck in next to lyrics which is also flying the same direction. Luckily the rhythm game is also very easy, so I guess it doesn\\'t matter too much.\\n\\nThat leaves exploration, which works as expected, there really is not much to say. Walk around and interact with the thing you need to move on. Sometimes this is painfully obvious, sometimes it\\'s annoyingly well hidden. Not much to say about this.\\n\\nAnd the final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is riddled with technical issues like random framedrops and bugs. Characters will frequently teleport, run into walls (and keep running in place), the camera can get stuck so you\\'re unable to proceed, you can lose the ability to run during combat, and sometimes prompts just doesn\\'t show up, forcing you to restart the game.\\n\\nUltimately this is a game that tries to be about diversity, friendship through hardship, and \"doing the right thing\", and I have to ask if giving the mean main character abilities like \"CANCEL\" that convinces the enemy to kill themselves really aligns with these ideas. It feels hypocritical, the game is a parody of itself.', 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 368, 'timestamp_created': 1725876514, 'timestamp_updated': 1725876514}\n",

Imagine trying to juggle three flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Blindfolded. That\\'s about as intuitive as it gets. Who needs balance or skill when you can just get obliterated by a Viking with the hand-eye coordination of a potato?\\n\\nAnd let’s talk about the online experience, which is basically a 50/50 gamble on whether you’ll be matched with an opponent or just a loading screen that lasts longer than your will to live. But when you do finally get into a game, you\\'re welcomed by the soothing sounds of your teammates hurling insults at each other because, let’s be real, that’s the true \"community spirit\" here.\\n\\nThe story mode? I didn’t even know it had one until I accidentally clicked on it, and I wish I hadn’t. It’s like a rejected script for a knockoff Game of Thrones fanfiction, but with less coherence and more facepalming.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re a masochist who loves the sensation of repeatedly slamming your head into a brick wall while listening to prepubescent kids yell obscenities, For Honor is the game for you.

Ubisoft has turned what could have been a great Viking adventure into a drawn-out, bloated, and lifeless experience.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the length of the game is absolutely unnecessary. Ubisoft has padded the game with an endless list of fetch quests, useless side missions, and tedious grinding that doesn't feel rewarding. Instead of focusing on meaningful content, Valhalla is stuffed with filler that only serves to artificially inflate the playtime. I’m all for open-world exploration, but when 80% of the game feels like busywork, it’s a problem.\\n\\nAnd then there's the story—or lack thereof. Valhalla arguably has the worst story in the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise. The narrative is disjointed, dull, and lacks any emotional depth. Eivor is a bland protagonist, and the Viking setting, which had so much potential, is squandered by uninspired writing. There’s none of the intrigue or historical depth that made previous titles great. It feels like the Assassin’s Creed identity has been lost in favor of trying to be a generic RPG.\\n\\nTo top it off, Ubisoft’s downward trend continues. Year after year, they seem to care less about delivering quality and more about milking the franchise with microtransactions, repetitive content, and lifeless worlds.

So I bought it.\\n\\nCoincidentally, not long before I played it, I watched Alex Garland\\'s \\'Civil War\\', that is also a road adventure in alternative USA (way more realistic and down-to-earth), and Dustborn is more of soft sci-fi dystopia. I kinda like all that alternative reality stuff, so the story kept me engaged.\\n\\nIf you enjoy Telltale and Dontnod games nothing is going to surprise you here. So, the emphasis is on story, and things like gameplay took a backseat. All you do is walk and talk basically, also there are an easy rhythm game and an easy combat system. \\n\\nI love the Dreamfall OST so much and this one was made in a very bad taste. Music, unfortunately, is extremely horrible, and it\\'s especially sad that it\\'s been stuck in my head for days. That only applies to the music the characters play, the rest is okay. And, yes, by the story the characters are not musicians and only pretending to be a band, but c\\'mon, this is some kind of a torture music.\\n\\nCombat is pretty primitive and boring, but after the first fight it gives you an option to choose a focus on a story - fights will be shorter and easier and you don\\'t have to waste time on it, that is good, I guess. I believe it\\'s a peculiarity of this genre to have some shitty sloppy action sequences.\\n\\nThe thing I liked is the social mechanic. it\\'s not like the aforementioned Telltale/Dontnod and whatever games, where at a certain moments you just choose A or B and it will decide the fate of the characters. Here it goes throughout the game as a result of communication with them, so they lean one way or the other (every character got like 2-3 traits they can lean to) and the endings of their stories will depend on how you affect them by communication. And as a surprise (soft spoiler warning for 5 people that might play it) in the end it turns out that your main character also had that traits, but hidden, so the main character made final decision by herself based on your actions throughout the game and you don\\'t have to choose A or B ending. I think it was an interesting approach and well-suited for this kind of games.\\n\\nThe visuals, which at first I really didn\\'t like at all turned out to be not so bad. Game has nice locations, you can change angles during dialogs, I love when you have that possibility and, overall, the visuals were pretty enjoyable for the most part. But on the other hand, the game has one of the worst character costume designs I\\'ve saw (when you\\'ll see the bikers and Eli you\\'ll understand). I\\'m sorry, but it is just horrendous. \\n\\nAlso, it has some bugs, like characters repeating same stuff twice, a couple of animation glitches and at one point after some fighting my character model just disappeared, so I had to restart the game, but luckily the progress has been maintained. I\\'d say it\\'s a very minor problems.\\n\\nThe story is fine, it kinda misses the world-building elements for me, like how did it come to this, what are the deal with all these fractions, why some wierd bikers gain so much power in certain territories, what happened in that often mentioned Broadcast event and why it happened, a lot of unanswered questions about the world, but they decided to go with a more character focused story instead. And the characters are alright, not perfect, dealing with their issues, but likable. All the voice actors did a good job. Yes, the are some eye-rolling moments here and there in dialog and as well as  plot-wise, but it’s tolerable.\\n\\nDialogs have some problems, too much and too unfunny quips that characters made. Other thing is characters talk too much with each other so if you interact and interfere their dialog it might bug and they will repeat it all over again, so the advise probably would be to let them finish first.\\n\\nOverall, I got to say, that I had extremely low expectations. I thought I would just buy the game and never play it, but I decided to give it a chance. Certainly, it\\'s not as terrible as people try to make it seem. it was an okay experience, so if you have a shortage of games of this genre, you can give it a try.

The sun casts golden rays on the Aegean Sea, casting shimmering reflections that make you feel the Mediterranean's warmth. Each locale, from the dizzying heights of the Spartan mountains to the labyrinthine streets of Athens, is crafted with painstaking detail, capturing the rich tapestry of Greek civilization in stunning, evocative visuals.\\n\\nWhat sets Odyssey apart is its RPG elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the core Assassin’s Creed experience. The skill tree is vast and varied, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. Whether you want to whisper through the shadows as a silent assassin or charge headlong into battle as a fearsome warrior, the game supports your playstyle with a rewarding progression system.\\n\\nThe dialogues and choices offered throughout the game have weight and consequence, propelling you into a narrative that is deeply personal yet woven into the grand tapestry of the Peloponnesian War. The story branches in ways that feel organic and engaging, ensuring that no two journeys are the same. Every decision, from engaging in philosophical debates with Socrates to making pivotal choices about the fate of entire cities, shapes your legend in the game’s world.\\n\\nThe combat is a blend of precision and spectacle. Abilities such as the Spartan kick provide gleefully cinematic moments, while the parrying and dodging mechanics offer a satisfying challenge. The naval combat, a beloved element from previous games, returns with grander scale and strategic depth. Sailing the Aegean, engaging in ship battles, and diving for underwater treasures are all exhilarating experiences that add layers to the exploration.\\n\\nYet, it's the small details that truly elevate this game. The meticulously researched historical accuracy, the dynamic weather system, the ambient soundscapes that make every environment feel alive—these elements collectively immerse you in a way few games manage.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed: Odyssey is a triumph, a grand tapestry of an era brought to life with passion and precision. It’s an adventure where every island, every myth, every choice adds to the epic saga that is your odyssey. If ever there was a game that proves the power of interactive storytelling, this is it.

It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\\n\\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.

Fun mechanics, beautiful graphics, great music and sound. I love the Disney-like cutscenes and art style, it immediately feels warm and familiar. No bugs to be seen, very surprising for a new game. The theme is Guardians of the Galaxy meets Overwatch, but the gameplay is fresh and interesting. I love the timed racing mode, it reminds me of Mirror's Edge parkour. More games should have skill trials like this. \\n\\nI'm sad to hear about Concord's early end. I guess people don't spend much money up front on multiplayer games since so many are F2P now. I don't blame anyone for saving money, but I guess we're stuck with loot boxes and virtual currencies forever. I hope Concord comes back with a F2P makeover so more people can see how fun it is.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 3, 'timestamp_created': 1725617461, 'timestamp_updated': 1725665536,

It's not quite as tactical as Overwatch and not as chaotic as CoD, but instead treads a satisfying middle ground. Characters are simple enough to just pick up and play, but partly also offer high skill ceilings.\\n\\nThe production values are through the roof, although it could do with some more content.\\n\\nAlso everyone who is tired of battleplasses and microtransactions should give this one a try. You get everything for your 40 bucks, not a single microtransaction to be found, contrary to popular beliefs of people who love to hate.\\n\\nIt is absolutely beyond me why this game is not received more positively.

It turns the whole experience into such mediocrity.\\n\\nOn one hand, the cutscenes are great, traversal is fun, all of the characters are written extremely well, the humour is genuinely funny and the story is pretty okay. However, on the other, it's bogged down by totally unnecessary systems like the battle pass, seasons, gear score, weapon loot and grinds. This game had crazy amounts of potential but I have no idea why all of that was pushed aside for, as one example, the sake of trying to artificially inflate play count by forcing them to grind.\\n\\nNevertheless, I'd only recommend this if it's on sale as there's definitely fun to be had with the characters and cutscenes. However, I would also recommend skipping the grind itself and pointless side missions and just focus on the story.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'timestamp_created': 1726652398,

The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.\", 'voted_up': True,

Or should I say For Torture? You know a game is great when you spend more time questioning your life choices than actually playing it. It\\'s like they took the mechanics of combat, ran them through a blender, and dumped them out in the middle of a lag-ridden, glitch-filled wasteland where \"honor\" is something you’ll never experience.\\n\\nThe combat? Imagine trying to juggle three flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Blindfolded. That\\'s about as intuitive as it gets. Who needs balance or skill when you can just get obliterated by a Viking with the hand-eye coordination of a potato?\\n\\nAnd let’s talk about the online experience, which is basically a 50/50 gamble on whether you’ll be matched with an opponent or just a loading screen that lasts longer than your will to live. But when you do finally get into a game, you\\'re welcomed by the soothing sounds of your teammates hurling insults at each other because, let’s be real, that’s the true \"community spirit\" here.\\n\\nThe story mode? I didn’t even know it had one until I accidentally clicked on it, and I wish I hadn’t. It’s like a rejected script for a knockoff Game of Thrones fanfiction, but with less coherence and more facepalming.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re a masochist who loves the sensation of repeatedly slamming your head into a brick wall while listening to prepubescent kids yell obscenities, For Honor is the game for you. For everyone else: save your time, save your money, and save your sanity.\\n10/10 would recommend', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'timestamp_created': 1726933741, 'timestamp_updated': 1726933741,

I was excited to download this game and play it on PC. That is until a popup for ubersoft came up, requiring me to make an ubersoft account to even install and play the game. This is called bait and switch. I paid my money to own my copy of this game on my computer and they did not disclose ahead of time that you are required to sell your data with another account, made in your name, with another company. Being forced to make a steam account to get PC games now days isn't enough, Now you have to have a steam account and then on top of that make accounts with all the companies producing the games also. These game companies and platforms just keep pushing and violating the rights of customers and they are going to push their selves out of buisiness. IF I BUY SOMETHING WITH MY HARD EARNED MONEY, I BETTER OWN IT AND HAVE ZERO ISSUES WITH PLAYING THE STANDARD GAME I PAID FOR. If it was a free game, then you can pull this shit, but not when a customer pays for the game. It's like going to buy a car, you pay for the car, then when your about to leave the lot, they say you can't leave the lot with your car until you give us any data and information we want for our company and other companies associated with us.\", 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 7, 'timestamp_created': 1727059237, 'timestamp_updated': 1727059237, 'title_vector': [-0.037832558155059814,

Watch Dogs 2, a game great for many reasons, one of which is that it made 'nerdy' characters relatable. The conversations the protagonists in that game had were dumb, but they were relatable in a way. \\n\\nThis game tries to do that and by God it does such a fucking horrible job at it. It's a DRIVING game. And a good one! Genuinely without the horribly written dialogue it would be so much better. \\n\\nAnyway, aside from that, it's a good game! The driving feels fucking amazing, the environment is great, the animations are great in first person, they feel somewhat natural unlike most games where you move the wheel like, 10°. I can't speak for whether this game is culturally insensitive or not so I'm just not gonna go into thst topic. \\n\\nGenuinely this is a fun game, I've had a blast with it so far, but some things do drag it back. \\n\\nOh, and support the people working on TCU. Ubisoft did a scummy move there, they've promised not to do it again but believing that is like believing Simon Harris when he says he cares about kids with scoliosis.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up':

Both the male and female leads are unremarkable , though the male is slightly better.\\n\\nAs for the story, the main plot is passable, but it feels repetitive. The characters are pretty forgettable, with only a few exceptions like Sigurd.\\n\\nThe side quests, however, are where the game truly lost me. The Niflheim segment, in particular, motivated me to write this review. Who thought this was a good idea? It’s like a frustrating \\'Hades\\' mode—if you die, you start from scratch, buying upgrades and fighting bosses along the way. The worst part? You can\\'t even quit unless you die, so after the first boss, I did just that. I honestly don\\'t see the point.\\n\\nThe game mechanics remain largely unchanged, especially in terms of stealth and parkour.\\nSometimes the climbing system gets stuck on small rocks or very short obstacles, forcing me to change direction just to get past. I usually give myself a few months between Assassin\\'s Creed titles to avoid burnout. The combat, though, is solid and challenging—the NPCs actually pose a threat, so there\\'s a silver lining but overall the weapons are not great, I much prefer Origins weapons variety and upgrade mechanics, to be fair though the \"weakpoints\" mechanism when using the bow introduced in this title is a very solid addition to combat.\\n\\nThe good thing is that I bought this game on sale,

In addition, I could project myself on how BORING this game is just by playing few hours into the game. I feel grateful that this feeling of devastation was also applied from many well spoken figures in the internet, even saying that they felt regret of spending the time to actually 100% finish the game in hope of something rewarding, which does not even happen. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion,\\r\\nLove the parkour? Get Unity\\r\\nLove the assassination mechanics? Get AC Classics, Unity and Mirage\\r\\nLove the history lessons? Get AC 2 - Revelations, III, IV, Unity, Syndicates, Origins, and Odyssey\\r\\nLove the beauty of the settings? Get AC 2 - Revelations, Unity, Syndicates, and Odyssey\\r\\nLove the plot? Get AC Classics, IV, Rogue and Origins\\r\\n\\r\\nAnything but Valhalla, for the sake of the best quality of your time. Only buy this game if you truly wants to turn off your brain and enjoy it for the sake of \"I just want to play some games whatever that is\", or if you are a diehard Viking fans and don\\'t even know

Ubisoft has turned what could have been a great Viking adventure into a drawn-out, bloated, and lifeless experience.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the length of the game is absolutely unnecessary. Ubisoft has padded the game with an endless list of fetch quests, useless side missions, and tedious grinding that doesn't feel rewarding. Instead of focusing on meaningful content, Valhalla is stuffed with filler that only serves to artificially inflate the playtime. I’m all for open-world exploration, but when 80% of the game feels like busywork, it’s a problem.\\n\\nAnd then there's the story—or lack thereof. Valhalla arguably has the worst story in the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise. The narrative is disjointed, dull, and lacks any emotional depth. Eivor is a bland protagonist, and the Viking setting, which had so much potential, is squandered by uninspired writing. There’s none of the intrigue or historical depth that made previous titles great. It feels like the Assassin’s Creed identity has been lost in favor of trying to be a generic RPG.\\n\\nTo top it off, Ubisoft’s downward trend continues. Year after year, they seem to care less about delivering quality and more about milking the franchise with microtransactions, repetitive content, and lifeless worlds. Valhalla is the perfect example of a game that prioritizes quantity over quality, and it shows.\\n\\nIn the end, I regret buying this game, and I can only hope Ubisoft listens to its fans before it’s too late. Unfortunately, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a game that has overstayed its welcome, and not in a good way.\", 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 3, 'timestamp_created': 1725811566, 'timestamp_updated':

The STORY is the part that really won me over. It got better the longer I stuck with it. I enjoyed the ability to make a LOT of choices, to influence my companions in their attitudes and ultimately myself - Pax.\\n\\nTakeaway: Found family touring across a really intense - intense mostly in how dangerous it felt - America as a mediocre punk rock band (mediocre because the BEST I could do in the rhythm minigames was an \"okay\" performance, haha).

in every sense ,  it wants to deliver a political agenda from an extreme left wing angle , sort of in an its ok for us to do it, but not the others kind of manner eg spoiler warning  you literally kidnap a young child , then it lectures about a certain faction doing  that with children.\\n\\nThen there is Pax who uses negative words to manipulate people into doing things against their will or Noam who pacifies will to do  things against their will , and it is  always using woke terms it is pretty amusing to watch first time round , however it will start to annoy you.\\n\\n\\nCombat needs more sound like using the base ball bat on a person sounds exactly the same as connecting to a giant robot , and hearing pax say \"stand down officers \" sort of makes me want to be an officer and grab her club and pound her with it .\\n\\nthere so much controversy involved in this game from tax payer funded issues to alleged  game assets theft , in a really messed up way i did like some of the game it is twisted ,its view is poor it even attacks Jesus , and christian faith yet avoids offending  the Muslim religion in game,  which it has a large lady beast who only covers her head in praying scenes , the whole cast is properly messed up and wants locking up or purging !!\\n\\nlook play it yourself , your choice its not for me  \\n\\nbut thanks for reading regardless', 'voted_up': False,

So I bought it.\\n\\nCoincidentally, not long before I played it, I watched Alex Garland\\'s \\'Civil War\\', that is also a road adventure in alternative USA (way more realistic and down-to-earth), and Dustborn is more of soft sci-fi dystopia. I kinda like all that alternative reality stuff, so the story kept me engaged.\\n\\nIf you enjoy Telltale and Dontnod games nothing is going to surprise you here. So, the emphasis is on story, and things like gameplay took a backseat. All you do is walk and talk basically, also there are an easy rhythm game and an easy combat system. \\n\\nI love the Dreamfall OST so much and this one was made in a very bad taste. Music, unfortunately, is extremely horrible, and it\\'s especially sad that it\\'s been stuck in my head for days. That only applies to the music the characters play, the rest is okay. And, yes, by the story the characters are not musicians and only pretending to be a band, but c\\'mon, this is some kind of a torture music.\\n\\nCombat is pretty primitive and boring, but after the first fight it gives you an option to choose a focus on a story - fights will be shorter and easier and you don\\'t have to waste time on it, that is good, I guess. I believe it\\'s a peculiarity of this genre to have some shitty sloppy action sequences.\\n\\nThe thing I liked is the social mechanic. it\\'s not like the aforementioned Telltale/Dontnod and whatever games, where at a certain moments you just choose A or B and it will decide the fate of the characters. Here it goes throughout the game as a result of communication with them, so they lean one way or the other (every character got like 2-3 traits they can lean to) and the endings of their stories will depend on how you affect them by communication. And as a surprise (soft spoiler warning for 5 people that might play it) in the end it turns out that your main character also had that traits, but hidden, so the main character made final decision by herself based on your actions throughout the game and you don\\'t have to choose A or B ending. I think it was an interesting approach and well-suited for this kind of games.\\n\\nThe visuals, which at first I really didn\\'t like at all turned out to be not so bad. Game has nice locations, you can change angles during dialogs, I love when you have that possibility and, overall, the visuals were pretty enjoyable for the most part. But on the other hand, the game has one of the worst character costume designs I\\'ve saw (when you\\'ll see the bikers and Eli you\\'ll understand). I\\'m sorry, but it is just horrendous. \\n\\nAlso, it has some bugs, like characters repeating same stuff twice, a couple of animation glitches and at one point after some fighting my character model just disappeared, so I had to restart the game, but luckily the progress has been maintained. I\\'d say it\\'s a very minor problems.\\n\\nThe story is fine, it kinda misses the world-building elements for me, like how did it come to this, what are the deal with all these fractions, why some wierd bikers gain so much power in certain territories, what happened in that often mentioned Broadcast event and why it happened, a lot of unanswered questions about the world, but they decided to go with a more character focused story instead. And the characters are alright, not perfect, dealing with their issues, but likable. All the voice actors did a good job. Yes, the are some eye-rolling moments here and there in dialog and as well as  plot-wise, but it’s tolerable.\\n\\nDialogs have some problems, too much and too unfunny quips that characters made. Other thing is characters talk too much with each other so if you interact and interfere their dialog it might bug and they will repeat it all over again, so the advise probably would be to let them finish first.\\n\\nOverall, I got to say, that I had extremely low expectations. I thought I would just buy the game and never play it, but I decided to give it a chance. Certainly, it\\'s not as terrible as people try to make it seem. it was an okay experience, so if you have a shortage of games of this genre, you can give it a try.

While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator.

The sun casts golden rays on the Aegean Sea, casting shimmering reflections that make you feel the Mediterranean's warmth. Each locale, from the dizzying heights of the Spartan mountains to the labyrinthine streets of Athens, is crafted with painstaking detail, capturing the rich tapestry of Greek civilization in stunning, evocative visuals.\\n\\nWhat sets Odyssey apart is its RPG elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the core Assassin’s Creed experience. The skill tree is vast and varied, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. Whether you want to whisper through the shadows as a silent assassin or charge headlong into battle as a fearsome warrior, the game supports your playstyle with a rewarding progression system.\\n\\nThe dialogues and choices offered throughout the game have weight and consequence, propelling you into a narrative that is deeply personal yet woven into the grand tapestry of the Peloponnesian War. The story branches in ways that feel organic and engaging, ensuring that no two journeys are the same. Every decision, from engaging in philosophical debates with Socrates to making pivotal choices about the fate of entire cities, shapes your legend in the game’s world.\\n\\nThe combat is a blend of precision and spectacle. Abilities such as the Spartan kick provide gleefully cinematic moments, while the parrying and dodging mechanics offer a satisfying challenge. The naval combat, a beloved element from previous games, returns with grander scale and strategic depth. Sailing the Aegean, engaging in ship battles, and diving for underwater treasures are all exhilarating experiences that add layers to the exploration.\\n\\nYet, it's the small details that truly elevate this game. The meticulously researched historical accuracy, the dynamic weather system, the ambient soundscapes that make every environment feel alive—these elements collectively immerse you in a way few games manage.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed: Odyssey is a triumph, a grand tapestry of an era brought to life with passion and precision. It’s an adventure where every island, every myth, every choice adds to the epic saga that is your odyssey. If ever there was a game that proves the power of interactive storytelling, this is it. Highly recommended for both ardent history buffs and avid gamers alike.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1725432817, 'timestamp_updated': 1725432817, 'title_vector':

It's obviously written by Leigh Alexander and her narrative voice shines through.  The graphics are beautiful especially for something made in Unity.  The atmosphere and music is nice although it can be slow at times.  You're basically exploring the narratives of your customers which are delivered episodically.  The final emotional battle between Savvy and Lina owes a lot to the insult sword fights from Monkey Island.\\n\\nWorth playing if you've got it in your backlog and worth a buy if it's 85% off.  It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\\n\\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.  Suzerain and The Pale Beyond are both better as games than Neo Cab, but it's no slouch and worth a look.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1726577538, 'timestamp_updated':

A mix of political commentary on the advances of technology, how that affects our humanity and the struggle to maintain a connection with people in an ever-evolving social scene. The fact that you see the world from your car\\'s seat through the eyes of your passengers, each with their own bias, wants and needs gives you a very nuanced and believable description of the world. In other words, worldbuilding at its finest, which fits perfectly with the cyberpunk theme! I can\\'t help but fell some Taxi Driver vibes, but in a less violent, more wholesome way.\\n\\nAlmost each passenger/customer gets their mini story arc formed of 2-3 trips and on top of that you have the main plot which is helping your mysterious childhood best friend. The dialogue can feel annoying at times because of the emotion-based mechanics locking you out of choices, but I have to respect the devs for sticking to the \"staying in touch with humanity\" theme, even if they took some risks.\\n\\nLastly, I have to give props to the beautiful art, music and the very convenient save system who gives you a checkpoint after every ride, so you can go back and take the game in a different direction any time.\\n\\nI just think it is highly respectable how such a small team of devs, with very limited resources, managed to create a game that makes you feel like you\\'re part of it not through hyper-real graphics or flashy mechanics, just through the power of dialogue and writing. Thank you Chance Agency for this experience and I\\'ll hope you\\'ll continue to make games with soul!', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'timestamp_created': 1725056515, 'timestamp_updated':

It's obviously written by Leigh Alexander and her narrative voice shines through.  The graphics are beautiful especially for something made in Unity.  The atmosphere and music is nice although it can be slow at times.  You're basically exploring the narratives of your customers which are delivered episodically.  The final emotional battle between Savvy and Lina owes a lot to the insult sword fights from Monkey Island.\\n\\nWorth playing if you've got it in your backlog and worth a buy if it's 85% off.  It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\\n\\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.  Suzerain and The Pale Beyond are both better as games than Neo Cab, but it's no slouch and worth a look.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1726577538, 'timestamp_updated':
