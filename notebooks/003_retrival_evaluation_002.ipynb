      "Review: Despite being an ambitious game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey often feels bloated. While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator. That said, the story is engaging and the historical setting is captivating, especially for fans of Ancient Greece. If you have the patience for the grind, there's still fun to be had\n",

I loved the first few weeks playing around. Loved the ongoing fight between Athene and Sparta and randomly side with them, discover places, sail around the galley, jumping and climbing. Looking the cities, villages. Discover islands. Loved that there is not that silly future part shoehorned in it, you pretty much play as that Greek hero and mercenary and slowly discover stuff around.\\nThe problem is its not really changing over time. There is no exciting new weapon or armour to play with. They all the same with slightly different stats. The content feels repeating. You may prefer to play sneaky, but there will be forced battles where you just cant play that style. There will be a point when you keep seeing the same type of place over and over again, you keep fighting the same battles and relive the same situations. \\nIts not bad but I just can get myself to finish it. After 60hr I felt I just playing circles and saw everything. Maybe I am wrong but I just cant see this game can change anyhow. It's not like ER where you find a new weapon what completely change the way you fight. You cant say you play as an Archer or a sneaky assassin as you keep getting into pit fights where you simply not allow to cheese up the enemy or outsmart it, but bind to play in one way and one way only.\\nThe game is huge and can give you content for ages but I feel its just scaled up  without any meaningful gameplay loop change. Playing the Athene - Sparta war is fun for a while.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1727560566, 'timestamp_updated': 1727560566, 'title_vector': [0.01829216629266739,

The sound and visuals were amazing. \\nThe story was pretty good. The combat was pretty good after about 20 hours of playtime i got used to the style. In some places the game was a bit bloated but overall experience was nice. I would say worst and terribly made were conquest battles. It could be much better and more immersive if you would have to attack or defend forts and complete objectives as war campaign. But in my opinion they wasted the opportunity for multiplayer which had SO MUCH potential as naval battles and with so many different abilities the combat would be amazing!!!', 'voted_up': True,

Team,\\n\\nI’m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\\n\\nEDIT : there’s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 989, 'timestamp_created': 1726803482, 'timestamp_updated': 1726816251}\n",

First one being once in a while during a cutscene the voices to lips will not be in sync. Sample while Shark is talking you will hear Harley's voice. While other people might get mad about that happening I find it sorta funny.\\n\\nAlso once in a while I noticed the game will freeze like the game locked up.

First of all, the innovative (albeit a bit flawed) Play As Anyone mechanic introduced in the video game allows players to recruit virtually any non-playable character in the open world, each bringing unique skills, backgrounds, and personalities to the fight against oppression. The roleplaying implications are vast, as you can immerse yourself in the lives of everyday Londoners, from construction workers and cryptocurrency analysts to paramedics and pickpockets, shifting your playstyle with each character. This mechanic encourages creative approaches to missions (in the simplest possible ways if you so desire) and fosters a deep connection to the individuals you recruit, making the rebellion against authoritarianism feel truly communal and diverse.\\n\\nThe factions in Watch Dogs Legion paint a vivid picture of the powers at play in dystopian London. DedSec, the group you belong to, is a grassroots resistance trying to free the city from the grip of oppressive organizations. Albion, a private military contractor, enforces martial law, symbolizing the rise of corporate-controlled security forces. Clan Kelley operates in the shadows, profiting off of London's underworld through human trafficking and black market deals. Meanwhile, the Signals Intelligence Response Service (SIRS), the intelligence agency, wields control over mass surveillance, presenting a chilling representation of how governments can abuse technology for control. Each faction not only serves as a formidable antagonist but also represents a different aspect of totalitarian rule, from corporate to criminal to governmental.\\n\\nSkye Larsen's story arc encapsulates the game's exploration of transhumanism, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. As the visionary behind advanced artificial intelligence and the leader of Project Daybreak (a project that aims to upload human consciousness into machines), Skye Larsen's ambitions raise ethical questions about identity, mortality, and the price of immortality. Her storyline serves as the darkest example of how technology in the wrong hands can dehumanize and exploit life itself. Skye Larsen's character and her experiments on her own family force players to confront the ethical nightmare of playing God, making her one of the most disturbing and tragic figures in Watch Dogs Legion.\\n\\nLondon, as reimagined in Watch Dogs Legion, is a masterclass in world-building, capturing the essence of the city while painting it in a dystopian light. Iconic landmarks such as the Tower of London, Camden Market, and Westminster Abbey are seamlessly integrated into a future where drones, surveillance cameras, and propaganda posters are omnipresent. The streets feel alive with the tension of a city under siege, from graffiti depicting resistance movements and Albion Contractors arresting innocent civilians in the streets after an identity check to automated checkpoints manned by Albion drones and Clan Kelley Associates harassing citizens to enforce their authority in controlled territories. This version of London feels both familiar and unsettling, a city at once modern and trapped under the weight of technological authoritarianism.\\n\\nThe documents scattered throughout the video game's open world and various missions enrich the narrative, giving players deeper insight into the lives of both the oppressors and the oppressed. Audio logs, text files, relics and dialogues reveal the motivations behind the factions, the corruption within the system, and the personal stories of those suffering under Albion and Clan Kelley's rule. These collectibles add layers to the main plot, providing context to major events and fleshing out characters who might otherwise seem one-dimensional or who don't even appear in the video game but played a crucial role in illustrating the violence in a dangerous dystopian London. Collecting these pieces of hidden lore rewards players with a fuller understanding of the world and the true stakes of DedSec's fight for freedom.\\n\\nWatch Dogs Legion, as a narrative video game (if you have this approach in mind when playing it), is a powerful reminder that in the face of overwhelming oppression, it is not just heroes who rise up, but everyday people who are united in the belief that together, they can reclaim their future.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1727017690, 'timestamp_updated': 1727017935}\n",

The banter between Cuff and Frey while exploring adds a bit of fun too. A lot of people don\\'t like Frey but i think she builds into a better character overall as you progress though the game and she has grown on me as a character so far.\\r\\nMany people judged her only on the first few impressions they got of her, i understand first impressions are the best but if i placed myself in her shoes and if i was warped away to a different world and could control magic i\\'d possibly have a similar reaction. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot to explore, I find myself discovering all the different locations and doing the side missions before i move on. Each place you finish will make you a little stronger with new spells, gear, or stat increases.\\r\\nOverall the graphics are quite beautiful as well and there are some stunning locations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is very fun, you can dash, jump, flip, and everything else while fighting and shooting out spells and there is a nice collection of different ones you can use. You can also switch out spells while fighting at a press of a button making it so you can combo your spell or switch to a defensive spell if needed quick. It feels very fluid and mixing movement and attacking is pretty well done. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also can\\'t comment on any lag, stutters, or anything like that. I am able to run the game on ultra settings without issue. The only graphical \"\"issues\"\" are the fires and skybox (some areas) in the game are look very low res and can break immersion a bit with how out of place it can look. \\r\\nI also did not buy the game at release so i cannot comment on previous issues regarding that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think this game deserves the hate it gets and I really am enjoying it and truthfully the only thing i can say you shouldn\\'t do is buy it full price.\\r\\nWhile i\\'ve given the game a lot of praise the price is not what it should be at and i feel it should have been $40 to start. The game isn\\'t very long and while i am taking my time and exploring everything i see i am already about halfway though the game and taking my time and while i am having fun it\\'s the kind of game for me personally i will do everything i find fun, finish the main story/DLC story and then uninstall. This really feels like a 1 time play through type of game but something you should give a try. \\r\\n\\r\\nSadly there will not be a 2nd game or more added to this world and that makes me a bit sad. I feel like the devs could have made the 2nd game a lot better taking the feedback they were given with this but too much at launch and other issues made the studio close (Merged to work on different Square games iirc). \\r\\n', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 9, 'timestamp_created': 1727075267, 'timestamp_updated': 1727075267}\n",

One thing I took note of was the constant mixed reviews regarding the game play and the storyline that was given to the players which was repetitive and boring as compared to the earlier versions of Assassins Creed (E.g Black flag). So I decided to just play it with an unbiased view of the game as I have with other Assassins Creed games.\\n\\nHere's what I love about this game - \\n\\nThe Long History of the game: Although they were straying far (hack and slash, assassinations, and the likes) from the original feels from the older versions like AC Unity or Black flag (that includes the dual axe wielding, long list of abilities you get to pick, etc...). This game puts you through a very long and a very exciting history lessons about various mythologies, Vikings, Iceland, Finland and Others. Because of this, I would recommend anyone who hates to sit through boring history lessons in class and play this instead, albeit it has been modified to fit the games objective so you need to research on the actual history to be more accurate, but my point still stands that it is a great game to learn about the history of other countries and mythologies through this game alone.\\n\\nThe Graphics: My PC is well above the need to run this game at maximum graphics, but of course i wanted to save some VRAMs so that it runs smoothly, which made me put everything to High and Medium instead. Even so, the graphics on this game was amazing and immersive enough for me to not realize that I played for 3 hours (sometimes 5 if i really get myself into the character) without having the need to get off my computer and rest.\\n\\nThe MAIN STORYLINE: This does not include the other packages that comes with the complete edition and just the Valhalla version itself. It took me 60+ hours just to complete the main storyline and another 80+ hours to complete the other storyline. This MAY seem long (or short if you are a speed runner) but it's such an immersive game that I took my time to enjoy everything this had to offer. If I had bought this game without the complete version at the original price, this would have been worth my time and money.\\n\\nVariety of Skills and abilities: This game provided with so much skills (either from skill trees, runic skills, Item abilities, Hugr-wrist, Abilities) that will suit the players game play experience. Although this again, strays off the original concept of the older games, I will probably find it boring if they kept using the original concept with no innovation put to it. \\n\\nHere's what I don't like about the game - \\n\\nThe mechanics of the game: Back then the game mechanics were way more simpler and easier to understand (I play on keyboard and mouse), so learning the new mechanics of this game was complicated as there was alot of keybinds to remember, which sometimes cause me to press the wrong keybind and losing boss fights (especially with Sutr on Very Hard).\\n\\nThe Falling Death bug: There are times where I get stuck in a falling animation during battles which just kills me instantly to make me get unstuck, which is frustrating since I was already almost done with the quest. This definitely needs to be fixed but other then that, the game is good and does not affect my overall experience or opinions of the game.\\n\\nTLDR: If you love immersive, historic and amazing graphics at medium settings, buy the original version, i recommend it. If you do not like to pay for full price, wait for another huge discount like i did and buy the complete edition for $40++.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1726055901, 'timestamp_updated': 1726065691}\n",

After investing over 370 hours, I can confidently say that it’s been one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had in my +16 years of gaming!\\n\\nAs someone who’s relatively new to games like Baldur\\'s Gate 3, The game has done wonders in introducing me to the complexities of D&D within a digital realm. The adaptation of traditional tabletop mechanics into a seamless and engaging gameplay experience is nothing short of remarkableness.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, the world of Faerûn feels alive and immersive, thanks to the stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The narrative is very engaging and full of twists, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful. The voice acting and character interactions are absolutely top-notch! Bringing the story and its inhabitants to life in a way that’s truly memorable.\\n\\nWhat really sets Baldur’s Gate 3 apart is its depth. With hundreds of quests, countless choices, and a variety of playstyles, there’s always something new to discover. The replayability is off the charts! Each playthrough can be a completely different experience! The flexibility in character creation and party dynamics allows you to craft a unique adventure every time.\\n\\nIf you’re a fan of RPGs in general or just looking for a game that offers a rich, engaging experience, Baldur’s Gate 3 is more than worth your time. My 370+ hours are a testament to its insane quality and replayability. This game has completely set a new standard for the genre! And I highly recommend it to anyone!\\n\\nThat said, if there is one \"downside\" that I could possible think of that is worth mentioning about Baldur\\'s Gate 3, It has to be the fact that it may not be the most welcoming for players who are completely new to the D&D aspect of the game [u] (Like me!) [/u] . The depth and complexity of the D&D mechanics can be daunting quite a bit at first, and it takes some time to fully grasp the nuances if you’re unfamiliar with the system. However, this challenge is also a blessing in disguise. It pushes you to learn and appreciate the intricacies of D&D, enriching your overall experience and deepening your understanding of the game’s mechanics. If you’re like me and are very excited to dive into the beauty of RPG with a truly remarkable blend with D&D, The feeling of immersion is something to totally embrace! \\n\\n[h3] ALSO! [/h3]\\n\\nI’m incredibly excited to see what Patch 7 has in store and how it will further enhance this already amazing game! A huge shoutout to Larian Studios and everyone who worked on this project. Your dedication and passion have created an absolute masterpiece and This game is a testament to your incredible talent and hard work, and I’m grateful for the unforgettable adventure you’ve given us all! \\n\\n[b] From the bottom of my heart.

Mostly what you always expect from FC games, but a little better than previous titles with all the tools that it puts in your hands.\\r\\n- Fantastic music and sounds! This is one of the fields that the game really shines in, with all the beautiful menu music, songs and, really, works of art. I mean, was it even necessary to make all those damn fine pieces of cult music? Don\\'t blame me if the \"only you\" track by The Platters gives you creeps from now on though. :D\\r\\n- Story. As you know, FC games have frequently been criticized for their story. I think FC5 has one of the best stories in FC series. It shows the subject of religion and cults and psychological manipulation well, and at the end leaves the decision if the father was right or not in your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\n- Stealth kind of becomes useless in harder difficulties cause enemies detect you so easily.\\r\\n- John\\'s character is a bit weaker than the other lieutenants.

First off, the map is vast, diverse, and really fun to explore. Lots of interesting and fun races and modes. The graphics are lovely, the physics of the vehicles feels interesting, as it does for an arcade game, and there’s a huge variety of cars and customization options to dive into. The audio design, including the soundtrack, complements the experience perfectly.\\nI\\'ve played Need for Speed: Payback, Unbound, and both Forza Horizon 4 and 5, and I have to say, I enjoy this game more. Right now, it feels like it\\'s worth every penny, especially with the Steam discount! The future also looks bright, thanks to the \"Playlists\" system, which brings a lot of variety to the races and seems like it will continue to expand the game with fresh content, and we have a major update coming soon with a new island.\\nThat said, there is one drawback: optimization. My 2022 setup handles 2K resolution decently, but sometimes there are drops in frames from stable 58-60, to 50, and it is felt. More advanced settings could really help smooth things out. Ubisoft could certainly work on polishing that aspect, and add some advanced settings.\\nOverall, I’d give it a solid 𝟖/𝟏𝟎 as an arcade racing game, and I think it could even challenge Forza in some ways.

It is still an amazing game. Then I see Motorfest is on sale as well, and you can transfer cars, which I thought was a nice addition. So after playing The Crew 2 for a few days I bought Motorfest.\\n\\n My initial reactions were not good. The intro was ok, but then you are forced to choose a playlist, which I didn't want to do, as I hadn't even been in the actual game yet, and I wasn't sure what I was even picking. I then choose a playlist and enter the game. Immediately disliked the amount and SIZE of all of the popups that flood your screen. I still haven't found out if there is a way to reduce the size of virtually everything.\\n\\nThen, of course, there is the playlists. Where The Crew 2 had, in my opinion, a fabulous system for organized and separate racing disciplines, The Crew Motorfest has NOTHING of the sort. EVERY SINGLE PLAYLIST is 100% loaned cars. The cars you own are only for replaying races already completed and PVP races.\\n\\nWant a playlist strictly for touring cars? Too bad! Want a playlist where you just get to race without NPC's giving you a storyline about the plot and background? Too bad! Motorfest has stripped virtually all of the progression that made the previous Crew games fun, and FORCE you to use other people's cars.\\n\\nThe map... good lord... the map. Hawaii should have been a DLC for The Crew 2. I want cross-country interstates, long snaking back-roads, mountain passes, and coastal roads that go on for what feels like an eternity. I feel like the enormous maps are kind of a staple for Crew games, no? The map is WAY too small compared to previous Crew games.\\n\\nNow the positive part. The graphics are very good. The sound design and quality... SUBLIME. Map quality and feel (regardless of size) is also very nice. I'm sort of torn on the handling, while I understand others' praise for the more simcade feel, which I like, I also loved the more arcade feel of handling in The Crew 2, just my preference.\\n\\nThis is a GOOD GAME, I just can't say I think it is a good Crew game. It feels nothing like the previous Crew games. I understand games are supposed to change and evolve, but I feel this changed in many ways I wasn't hoping it to.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this game to fans of previous Crew games who loved them for the same reasons I did.\\n\\nLastly, please let us set TCS, ESC, and ABS PER VEHICLE!\\n\\nThank you.\", 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 25, 'timestamp_created': 1726871330, 'timestamp_updated': 1726871330}\n",

It pretty masterfully weaves the stealth elements of the Assassin\\'s Creed series into the action RPG, which is great--there\\'s nothing more satisfying than clearing out an entire camp of enemies before any of them notice you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings I loved:\\r\\n-The main quest-or \"Odyssey\" has three separate branches that interconnect with each other and the hundreds of side quests. One of these branches involves you hunting down members of an evil cult that\\'s trying to control the Greek world. I found it extremely satisfying hunting down clues to discover the cultist\\'s identities and then finally hunting down and assassinating these targets.\\r\\n-Many engaging sidequests, and they have player guidance down to a science--you\\'ll be on your way to do one thing, discover a sidequest along the way, and get completely sidetracked and uncover all the cool things to do in each region.\\r\\n-I played Kassandra and she\\'s such a lovely character who is voiced so well. The dialogue is written well too, I especially loved Athens and getting to have debates with Sokrates, Herodotus, Perikles, and other real historical figures. They\\'re all done such great justice. \\r\\n-The skill tree has a lot of great abilities, broken down into ranged, melee, and stealth builds. You can respec at any time and try out quite a few different playstyles. \\r\\n-The game runs like a dream and is beautiful, even on older hardware. I have a Ryzen 5 1600 and a GeForce 1660 and I\\'m able to run the game at Very High settings 60fps.\\r\\n-Combat is smooth and exciting. It\\'s pretty well telegraphed when an enemy is going to use a move you need to dodge instead of parry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings I hated:\\r\\n-Obnoxious, dirty cash shop. I\\'d recommend engaging with this as little as possible especially the \"time savers\" that give you extra gold, XP, crafting resources--you will farm all you need of this stuff just by playing the game.\\r\\n-The loot grind. You will get dozens of pieces of gear per hour, most of which is useless. It comes in four varieties: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Common has 1 buff, Rare has 2 buffs, Epic has 3 buffs, and Legendary has 2 buffs but a special Set Bonus when you have the full set equipped. Common + Rare is strictly worse than Epic and Legendary, so whenever you get white or blue gear you might as well sell it or strip it for crafting materials which is tedious. The strongest min-max builds of the game require you rolling a good set of Epic Gear, but honestly you\\'ll have a better time just finding a legendary set you like and rolling with that all game--in which case, the loot grind becomes even more meaningless.\\r\\n-the timed \"daily missions\" etc are usually not very good but they drop tons of resources and are often convenient enough/on your way enough that you might as well do them. They absolutely feel like filler though.\\r\\n-I\\'m finishing up the second DLC as I write this and after 143 hours the game is finally starting to feel like a slog. I much preferred the first DLC which is incorporated into the main game\\'s map, rather than the second DLC which takes you to three separate world maps. The first and third maps of the second DLC look great though.\\r\\n-Though I understand why it\\'s done this way, the endless level scaling makes it hard to feel like you\\'re progressing much. Also a little immersion breaking when you\\'ve fought literal gods and demons and then ten hours later you\\'re fighting random greek soldiers who are just as hard.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1727351539, 'timestamp_updated': 1727351539}\n",

Either pay or spend another 10 hours and even after you will most likely level up and your things won't be so cool anymore. 99 levels? Are you kidding me? And for what purpose? Auto-leveling system won't let you feel your proggression unless you find some cheese strategy. I like Origins location-based system more, but that's just for me. \\nOkay, in fact you don't need to have 99 level unless you really want to and it's not the biggest problem of the game. I feel like the biggest problem is world itself for sure. Yes. indeed it is beautiful and devs can have my credit for this, but tell me why it's so...dead and empty? Yes, we have tons of collectables and lots of question marks on the map - much more than Origins have - but even so the desert of Egypt appears to be more lively and enjoyable. I just don't want to explore the world where all I can find is another outpost which is, don't get me wrong, bad for Origins too. Yes some may like it, but for me it is a lazy way to fill the map. \\nI can't say anything for the main storyline. It's not bad, it's just fine unless you realize that you have no assassin in assasin's creed game. And even DLC 'Legacy of The First Blade' which could explain a lot of things about hidden blade, how it was created and why such a design, it tells you everything but not about hidden blade. I haven't finished DLC's yet (and I won't, at least right now) but I have seen how it ends and I have just one question: WHY the hidden blade was given to Aya by Cleopatra IF it's Aya's family legacy? \\n\\nDoes the game have nothing to offer? Well, it is not true. I like mercenary system and cultist system (though it needs to be improved). Combat system is better than it was in origins though why I have paranormal naruto-ninja techniques...okay, it's ancient technology and animus. Okay, let it be. Odyssey also have some fine quests lines, I even chuckled at some of them, but guess that's all.\\n\\nSome dude once commented my profile and said that 'Origins and Odyssey will be my best experience' and that I should try them necessarily and I was like 'Yeah, sure I'll try them out'. And now I'm dissapointed. I really liked origins, it was not the best game in any way but I had my fun, but here...nothing. And unfortunately Odyssey is the first game in the series which I'm NOT reccomend to buy unless you are fan or it's on a huge discount. Yes, I have heard that Valhalla explains a lot and fixes a lot, but I rate the game here and now and at this condition...No.\", 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1727400652, 'timestamp_updated': 1727400652}\n",

The design team did their job wonderfully and gave us a Gotham design that\\'s almost on par with Arkham Knight\\'s Gotham. Still it lacks substance - the staggering absence of details around the city, and the unvaried building structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real downsides of Gotham Knights are many, namely the horrendous gameplay, bad story progression, uncreative and repetitive side activities, etc. Its combat takes away all the things that made Batman Arkham games great, and gives us a jankier Sleeping Dogs. Sometimes it\\'s required to do Ubisoft-styled missions in order to progress story, meaning you have to find \"clues\" or interrogate thugs through random events. The story progression system is truly evolving backwards. The batcycle is slow AF, the game has to add a wind blowing filter to make it look fast lol. There\\'re also a tons of what I consider to be minor issues, like NPCs repeat lines way too often, NPC models vanish soon as enter a camera blind spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll those I can still endure. But my current biggest gripe with it is the the genuinely unfun experience resulting from a combination of widely scattered side activities and severely downgraded (from the Batman Arkham games) traversal system. Gliding and grappling speed is somewhere between Arkham City and Knight, but the traversal as a whole feels wrong on many level - there\\'s no physics or a good sense of control to it. And the lack of detail in Gotham only makes going around the map even worse. \\r\\n\\r\\nTL;DR - the design dev team is 9/10 but the gameplay dev team is 5/10', 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 9, 'timestamp_created': 1726371921, 'timestamp_updated': 1726371921}\n",

Right off the bat, my first piece of advice to you is not to get it for full price. Maybe when it\\'s off by 50% or more. Because when \"Gotham Knights\" is fairly priced, it\\'s honestly quite an enjoyable time. Oh, and yes: you can play the entire game solo. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, full disclosure: I love the Batman Arkham games and Red Hood is one of my favorite DC characters, so that certainly helped me get over some of the glaring flaws in this title. But I won\\'t shy away from admitting that those exist and are quite annoying at times. Even with that, though, when Gotham Knights works it becomes really fun. \\r\\n\\r\\nIs it more fun than any of the Arkham games that came before it? No. Not by a long shot. And I\\'m one of the guys that thinks that \"Arkham Knight\" is underrated, so you can imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, then, let\\'s start with the good. The art direction in this game is fantastic. We\\'ve got good ol\\' gloomy Gotham, but bathed in neon, which is a great idea, honestly. Then we\\'ve got the main cast: great character designs and awesome costumes. Voice acting is great, but the writing really, really brings it down. I\\'ll phrase it like this: have you watched \"Arrow\"? Do you know how that show is sometimes written in a turbo-cringe way, but it remains enjoyable because it is charming? Well, here it\\'s the same, but without any of the charm. You\\'ve got the whole schtick: from forced inclusivity all the way to self-serving plot elements. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that, though, the story itself -- as an idea -- is great. It\\'s not executed in the best of ways, sure, and any one among you that has been a Batman fan for at least five minutes would see where it\\'s going about 4 hours in, but hey: I appreciate the effort. The important thing is that the game is fun to play. I mean, sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, okay, here\\'s the problems: characters get stuck on everything. Moves don\\'t connect properly. Abilities sometimes trigger, other times don\\'t, and then sometimes they also miss entirely. Heavy attacks with some characters are utterly pointless. City navigation, with some characters, is incredibly dull and boring. Figuring out what to do, sometimes, is exceptionally difficult. And, of course, the very fact that this game was built multiplayer-first is an issue to the extent where I absolutely wish it was not. \\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and textures fail to load-in properly half the time, which results in a mix of HD and SD content that looks, well… Unique. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, have you played any of the Arkham games? You know how you feel in total control of Batman? Well, here it\\'s not the case. In fact, far from it. When it works, it feels like a broken Arkham game, when it does not: it\\'s a pain. But something in my broken brain was okay with that. Whether it was because I like the games that came before this one or due to the core gameplay loop being fun: I honestly cannot be sure. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a lot to do in this game. Levelling up and unlocking gear is fun. The provided skill trees are utterly pointless, so you\\'ll probably forget that they even exist. The very idea of a progression system, however, carries that extra bit of satisfaction. Unfortunately, there is content locked behind levels and gear requirements and I just didn\\'t partake in any of it. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gotham Knights\" isn\\'t a bad idea, but it\\'s a bad execution. If it was built like a proper Arkham game from the ground up, I have no doubt in my mind that it would\\'ve been a ton more fun. That being said: it is still a good time for Batman nerds and Arkham fans. If anything, this title proves that there is certainly an  audience for spinoff Arkham games. So long as they are single-player and their content isn\\'t locked behind a poorly designed progression system. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a personal level, I think that Red Hood’s campaign here does the character service. And that’s a tough thing to do, considering what DC has done to Jason in the past. He’s not always written well, but ultimately he gets a nice, neat character ark that just feels proper after the events of “Arkham Knight”.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 48, 'timestamp_created': 1725088832, 'timestamp_updated': 1725088832}\n",

Set eight years into Peter Parker\\'s career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter’s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\\nThe game’s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It’s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\\n\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man’s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the \\'Batman: Arkham\\' series.\\nThe game\\'s skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don\\'t have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\\nHowever, the gameplay isn’t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game\\'s otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\\n\\nWorld: \\n\\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man’s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n\\nHaving previously played \\'Spider-Man (2018)\\' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections—especially with ray tracing enabled—adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they’re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\\n\\nMusic/Sound Design:\\n\\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game’s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen—intensifying during combat or when you’re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it’s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker’s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker\\'s personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it\\'s obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\\n\\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:(', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 68, 'timestamp_created': 1726241825, 'timestamp_updated': 1726241825}\n",

This is a Norwegian developed game, which is partly funded by Viken, which is where I grew up! So I had to give it a fair shake.\\nI enjoy walking sims, and I enjoy a lot of games that do their best to focus on diversity; are all the negative reviews just \"anti woke haters\"?\\n\\nSadly the game comes across as a parody of itself, and it\\'s hard to take anything seriously.\\n\\nI think there are overall two main issues with the story. Firstly, it suffers from having a \"fighting game story\", where there are too many characters with too many backstories to give proper attention to all of it, so random parts are just shoehorned together.\\nFor example, a character might say early on that they are self conscious and anxious. Instead of this being a part of their identity, and they show these signs throughout the story, they will just randomly have a scene where they are acting extremely out of character to show this trait which was mentioned prior.\\nThere\\'s a scene (very mild spoilers) where you need to open a locked door. One of your main crew members have a power to do exactly that. Keep in mind, you have been chased across multiple state borders, the cops could be here at any moment, so you need to hurry and get inside. This crew member tells you \"No, I think I will skip this one, I am feeling self conscious and don\\'t just wanna be seen as a door opener, I am not feeling it right now\", and you tell them that it is okay, you respect their boundaries and don\\'t wanna make them uncomfortable. This comes across as very off character, because this is not how they have acted previously, and now that we need them the most it\\'s all of the sudden a big problem?\\n\\nThe writers want to add good messages to each character and their conditions, but sadly the writers are not good at making it a part of the story, so they very explicitly and on the nose force situations like these, that ultimately fails to deliver the message and just makes the character look like an idiot.\\nDo I believe that when you\\'re having a bad mental health day you should be given space, time and respect? Yes, 100%, but no one would act like this in a life or death situation.\\n\\nThis also goes the other way, where the character mentions something about themselves that is critical to keep in mind, such as a character turning into a helpless statue if they get too anxious, but this is never brought up again.\\n\\nThe second issue the game really suffers from is the idiot plot. This means that the story only moves forward due to idiot decisions, and this is very much true here.\\nThe whole plot is about a stealth mission, let us make our cover story that we are a band so we constantly have to show up to public places and make noise. Also, all our songs are about the mission we\\'re on. Glad no one caught on to that.\\nOh, let us give the one thing we are supposed to protect to our team captain that loses it twice within the first couple of hours of the game.\\nLet us, on our undercover mission, drive a one-of-a-kind bus with bright colors and branding on it.\\nWe\\'re in a bar full of cops when we know some of them are looking for us?

They hate your guts, don\\'t want to see you, don\\'t want to travel with the crew, you are dead to them, then one minor event happens and they go \"You saved myu life, I love you, you\\'re my sister again\"\\n\\nThe worst part is that most of the core crew are just... unlikable? The main character Pax is an asshole who bullies and berates anyone she meets, including her friends. Your crew members either don\\'t wanna be there or constantly talk. They talk about absolutely nothing, like a 20 second rant about how their parents used to make a dish. Pax, the main character, is selfish, lies to the crew, and puts them in danger multiple times just to fulfill her own curiosity.\\nThe other members talk holes into my head about drawing or random memories, thoughts or dreams they have. None of which build their character, or give interesting insight to the world.\\n\\nThe dialogue in itself is also very poorly written, and that includes choices you can make. Often dialogue is repeated, which makes for very awkward sounding conversations.\\n\"I\\'m heading off to bed, it\\'s late\"\\n\"We got a long day ahead tomorrow, and it\\'s late, so I\\'m going to sleep\"\\nThis type of writing where the character repeats what they just said is common, and it ruins the immersion. Another issue with the writing is that the game often wants to take the story in a certain direction, but they also want to engage the player. This means that often you will get the \"choice\" between two almost identical prompts, or even worse, you will get a \"choice\" to select one singular prompt, which you might disagree with. This makes for a very frustrating experience when you would do something completely different, or nothing at all in a situation, but you are forced to be an asshole.\\n\\nAs for the gameplay itself, combat is infuriatingly easy, you are practically invincible, and while you have both a dodge and a block, you don\\'t need any of them in any encounter. I read online that you can\\'t die, so I tried to lose on purpose in one of the encounters, and yep, you just stand back up again like nothing happened and continue fighting. The enemies don\\'t even regain health.\\nYou can beat any encounter using the throw bat mechanic as enemies are infinitely stunned, but honestly you could also just mash X.\\n\\nAs for the rhythm game, it\\'s bad. There\\'s a reason no other game has a layout like this. It is difficult to see notes flying and in what order, especially when they they are snuck in next to lyrics which is also flying the same direction. Luckily the rhythm game is also very easy, so I guess it doesn\\'t matter too much.\\n\\nThat leaves exploration, which works as expected, there really is not much to say. Walk around and interact with the thing you need to move on. Sometimes this is painfully obvious, sometimes it\\'s annoyingly well hidden. Not much to say about this.\\n\\nAnd the final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is riddled with technical issues like random framedrops and bugs. Characters will frequently teleport, run into walls (and keep running in place), the camera can get stuck so you\\'re unable to proceed, you can lose the ability to run during combat, and sometimes prompts just doesn\\'t show up, forcing you to restart the game.\\n\\nUltimately this is a game that tries to be about diversity, friendship through hardship, and \"doing the right thing\", and I have to ask if giving the mean main character abilities like \"CANCEL\" that convinces the enemy to kill themselves really aligns with these ideas. It feels hypocritical, the game is a parody of itself.', 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 372, 'timestamp_created': 1725876514, 'timestamp_updated': 1725876514}\n",

I am willing to bet my Canadian pesos that if you show a random person a picture of Teo, they would be hard pressed to tell you which game he's from. The character design is not just a failure in an aesthetic sense: given that many of the crucial roles are so visually unappealing, in random games (the only ones you can currently play due to the aforementioned lack of players) everyone will lock down the same 4 or 5 characters, which results in poor team compositions. Now I am not saying that every game needs anime waifus, but it is very important to make support and tank characters visually appealing, so that people would want to pick them.

I purchased it on an 80% sale @ $14 and this is WELL worth a $14 game.\\n\\nThe combat is fast paced, yet slightly janky... it's a dumbed down melee brawler derived from the Arkham series to allow for better designed and satisfying ranged combat. Traversal is reminiscent of Gotham Knights less the horrendous vehicle physics, the use of vehicles in this game are more polished and responsive.\\n\\nMetropolis is a beautifly designed city although you only effectively use a portion of it in game, giving a 1930/40's vibe as a tribute to the age DC comics originally came up with their heroes and also has a somewhat futuristic and multi-layered design.\\n\\nThe boss fights pose a challenge and have a much grander feel to fighting the front-line forces, however, it still doesn't feel like you're actually taking on the Justice League, more so their nerfed counter parts. (Except for Green Lantern early on because of well, plot armour)\\n\\nThe voice acting is well done and the story takes on a reasonable pace that keeps up with your level progression.\\n\\nMy positives for the game:\\n\\n1. Fast-paced gameplay that requires variety, yet does become tedious with all the mechanics involved.\\n2. Beautifully crafted city with limitless traversal\\n3. A wide selection of weapons and equipables to cater to one's preferred playstyle\\n4. The story of 4 miscreants with 0 chemistry being constantly back-stabbed is fitting, although some characters are just too much\\n5. Somewhat quick linear progression where the game tends to throw everything at you within the first few hours. Some people may not enjoy this.\\n6. There is a wide variety of missions that revolve around 3-4 basic tropes that you would find in a game like this that do throw different varieties of enemies at you to keep you on your toes.\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats:\\n\\n1. Captain Boomerang is annoying AF, I understand that it is his character, but, they could've toned this down just a bit\\n2. Deadshot is a whiny Karen, also could have been toned down\\n3. The skill trees don't allow for true character customisation as they should as you earn points that alternate between trees as you level up. You also only get a single perk to choose from at times which doesn't really give you that RPG feel that they were going for. However, some choices, when you do get them make drastic enough changes to your character. \\n5. Combat has a myriad of mechanics involved and can be a bit wonky at times\\n\\nOther than that, I was never expecting another game tied in to the Arkham lore, and Rocksteady did put monumental effort into making a fresh, new IP (and i feel that they were successful in doing so, yet the game itself was not well received), so, I'm not as butt-hurt as the majority of the fan base, nor am I too particularly happy about it being a live service game, but it is what it is.\\n\\nAll-in-all this is a genuine 7/10 game if you're going to focus on getting through the story.

The banter between Cuff and Frey while exploring adds a bit of fun too. A lot of people don\\'t like Frey but i think she builds into a better character overall as you progress though the game and she has grown on me as a character so far.\\r\\nMany people judged her only on the first few impressions they got of her, i understand first impressions are the best but if i placed myself in her shoes and if i was warped away to a different world and could control magic i\\'d possibly have a similar reaction. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot to explore, I find myself discovering all the different locations and doing the side missions before i move on. Each place you finish will make you a little stronger with new spells, gear, or stat increases.\\r\\nOverall the graphics are quite beautiful as well and there are some stunning locations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is very fun, you can dash, jump, flip, and everything else while fighting and shooting out spells and there is a nice collection of different ones you can use. You can also switch out spells while fighting at a press of a button making it so you can combo your spell or switch to a defensive spell if needed quick. It feels very fluid and mixing movement and attacking is pretty well done. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also can\\'t comment on any lag, stutters, or anything like that. I am able to run the game on ultra settings without issue. The only graphical \"\"issues\"\" are the fires and skybox (some areas) in the game are look very low res and can break immersion a bit with how out of place it can look. \\r\\nI also did not buy the game at release so i cannot comment on previous issues regarding that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think this game deserves the hate it gets and I really am enjoying it and truthfully the only thing i can say you shouldn\\'t do is buy it full price.\\r\\nWhile i\\'ve given the game a lot of praise the price is not what it should be at and i feel it should have been $40 to start. The game isn\\'t very long and while i am taking my time and exploring everything i see i am already about halfway though the game and taking my time and while i am having fun it\\'s the kind of game for me personally i will do everything i find fun, finish the main story/DLC story and then uninstall. This really feels like a 1 time play through type of game but something you should give a try. \\r\\n\\r\\nSadly there will not be a 2nd game or more added to this world and that makes me a bit sad.

Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game’s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor’s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game’s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\\n\\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England—from the rolling hills of England’s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor’s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game’s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game’s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\n\\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware.

One thing I took note of was the constant mixed reviews regarding the game play and the storyline that was given to the players which was repetitive and boring as compared to the earlier versions of Assassins Creed (E.g Black flag). So I decided to just play it with an unbiased view of the game as I have with other Assassins Creed games.\\n\\nHere's what I love about this game - \\n\\nThe Long History of the game: Although they were straying far (hack and slash, assassinations, and the likes) from the original feels from the older versions like AC Unity or Black flag (that includes the dual axe wielding, long list of abilities you get to pick, etc...). This game puts you through a very long and a very exciting history lessons about various mythologies, Vikings, Iceland, Finland and Others. Because of this, I would recommend anyone who hates to sit through boring history lessons in class and play this instead, albeit it has been modified to fit the games objective so you need to research on the actual history to be more accurate, but my point still stands that it is a great game to learn about the history of other countries and mythologies through this game alone.\\n\\nThe Graphics: My PC is well above the need to run this game at maximum graphics, but of course i wanted to save some VRAMs so that it runs smoothly, which made me put everything to High and Medium instead. Even so, the graphics on this game was amazing and immersive enough for me to not realize that I played for 3 hours (sometimes 5 if i really get myself into the character) without having the need to get off my computer and rest.\\n\\nThe MAIN STORYLINE: This does not include the other packages that comes with the complete edition and just the Valhalla version itself. It took me 60+ hours just to complete the main storyline and another 80+ hours to complete the other storyline. This MAY seem long (or short if you are a speed runner) but it's such an immersive game that I took my time to enjoy everything this had to offer. If I had bought this game without the complete version at the original price, this would have been worth my time and money.\\n\\nVariety of Skills and abilities: This game provided with so much skills (either from skill trees, runic skills, Item abilities, Hugr-wrist, Abilities) that will suit the players game play experience. Although this again, strays off the original concept of the older games, I will probably find it boring if they kept using the original concept with no innovation put to it. \\n\\nHere's what I don't like about the game - \\n\\nThe mechanics of the game: Back then the game mechanics were way more simpler and easier to understand (I play on keyboard and mouse), so learning the new mechanics of this game was complicated as there was alot of keybinds to remember, which sometimes cause me to press the wrong keybind and losing boss fights (especially with Sutr on Very Hard).\\n\\nThe Falling Death bug: There are times where I get stuck in a falling animation during battles which just kills me instantly to make me get unstuck, which is frustrating since I was already almost done with the quest. This definitely needs to be fixed but other then that, the game is good and does not affect my overall experience or opinions of the game.\\n\\nTLDR: If you love immersive, historic and amazing graphics at medium settings, buy the original version, i recommend it. If you do not like to pay for full price, wait for another huge discount like i did and buy the complete edition for $40++.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1726055901, 'timestamp_updated': 1726065691}\n",

The sun casts golden rays on the Aegean Sea, casting shimmering reflections that make you feel the Mediterranean's warmth. Each locale, from the dizzying heights of the Spartan mountains to the labyrinthine streets of Athens, is crafted with painstaking detail, capturing the rich tapestry of Greek civilization in stunning, evocative visuals.\\n\\nWhat sets Odyssey apart is its RPG elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the core Assassin’s Creed experience. The skill tree is vast and varied, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. Whether you want to whisper through the shadows as a silent assassin or charge headlong into battle as a fearsome warrior, the game supports your playstyle with a rewarding progression system.\\n\\nThe dialogues and choices offered throughout the game have weight and consequence, propelling you into a narrative that is deeply personal yet woven into the grand tapestry of the Peloponnesian War. The story branches in ways that feel organic and engaging, ensuring that no two journeys are the same. Every decision, from engaging in philosophical debates with Socrates to making pivotal choices about the fate of entire cities, shapes your legend in the game’s world.\\n\\nThe combat is a blend of precision and spectacle. Abilities such as the Spartan kick provide gleefully cinematic moments, while the parrying and dodging mechanics offer a satisfying challenge. The naval combat, a beloved element from previous games, returns with grander scale and strategic depth. Sailing the Aegean, engaging in ship battles, and diving for underwater treasures are all exhilarating experiences that add layers to the exploration.\\n\\nYet, it's the small details that truly elevate this game. The meticulously researched historical accuracy, the dynamic weather system, the ambient soundscapes that make every environment feel alive—these elements collectively immerse you in a way few games manage.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed: Odyssey is a triumph, a grand tapestry of an era brought to life with passion and precision. It’s an adventure where every island, every myth, every choice adds to the epic saga that is your odyssey. If ever there was a game that proves the power of interactive storytelling, this is it.

She\\'s just moved in to the city to live with her best friend from the past whom she hasn\\'t seen in ages. However, on the first night, her friend goes missing and Lina takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her friend and who is responsible while at the same time trying to make a living by driving passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a sense, Neo Cab is a hybrid of a visual novel story and management gameplay which involves serving customers, making enough money to get by, and making sure your star rating stays high. Normally, this kind of genre mixing can be risky, but what the game has is connected well enough, without either aspect getting in the way of the other. The story is giving us an end goal to strive towards, whereas the management aspect is giving us something to do and think about while we\\'re progressing through the plot. The gameplay isn\\'t complicated really and all you need to keep track of are your money and your rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile transporting customers, we get to learn a bit about them. They come in all kinds, the young and the old, the boring and the weird, the friendly and the hostile. Most (if not all) of them we get to meet multiple times throughout the game, so we get to know them really well and they could end up even helping us along during the main plot. In the way the customers are integrated into the game\\'s story is pretty decent because we do learn something from each of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the game loop is quite simple - you drive 3 customers per night, and occasionally visit some story-related location, then spend the night at a motel or one of those futuristic capsules, and then do the same the next night till six nights have passed. I personally was quite surprised how quickly and somewhat abruptly the game ended. I kind of expected it to go on for longer, with investigation taking more nights and requiring more tasks on our behalf, but it was pretty short and for many players might feel rather underwhelming. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe game\\'s world is interesting and tackles interesting subjects relating to the near future, particularly automation of the workforce and the ways in which corporations could use and abuse new technology for their own personal benefit. But the main plot of searching for your friend and uncovering what on Earth she got involved in fell rather short in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we interact with customers and any other characters, we often are given dialogue choices of what to say. This can impact how they feel about us and whether they would give us a good rating or share important information with us. One annoyance though that many other players seem to agree with is that the game often doesn\\'t let you pick the dialogue choices you want to pick, possibly because the character is not in the right mood or something, so they outright refuse to say what you tell them to say. And speaking of their mood - it seems to jump all over the place at the drop of a hat, and this can be very hard to keep track of, especially that most times it really isn\\'t clear how a particular dialogue branch will affect her mood. Most times you might as well just taking a wild guess at it (we can see how her mood gets changed due to a device she starts wearing on her wrist from early on in the game).\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphically the game is magnificent. In fact, the visuals are probably its biggest strength. The whole art style is very colourful, pleasing and in great style, fitting that neo-future aesthetic the game is going for. Coupled with decent background music in the style of synthwave, and the game is pretty enjoyable in its presentation. There is no voice acting here, which to some players may seem odd for a game like this, but to me personally it wasn\\'t a big deal as I just treated it as a visual novel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the save system could be vastly improved though. It isn\\'t clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn\\'t save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don\\'t see a reason why the game couldn\\'t just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn\\'t save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I\\'d say, if you\\'re not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you\\'re not missing out.

It isn\\'t clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn\\'t save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don\\'t see a reason why the game couldn\\'t just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn\\'t save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I\\'d say, if you\\'re not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you\\'re not missing out. If you are a fan of these things, then best to get it on a discount.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 14, 'timestamp_created': 1725227970, 'timestamp_updated': 1725227970}\n",

The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.\", 'voted_up': True,

Really takes you out of the game. To be honest, I absolutely hate it, it's an absolute blunder on the side of Ubisoft. My favourite parts of the Far Cry Series was that you viewed EVERYTHING as the character. Especially interactions with the villains. It was extremely immersive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the gameplay between scenes is quintessential Far Cry. The firefights, the weapons, the slight ridiculousness in weapons and fighting. The actual gameplay is ALL Far Cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really wanted to hate this game after the first non immersive scene. It really made me angry, to see one of my favourite series ruined in that way. But when I kept playing, it really felt like Far Cry. Both the story and the gameplay are absolutely amazing.

recordings are far to quite or sound as if they were recorded from far away or with a low quality microphone.\\nAssets seem to be directly stolen from GTA Online, such as the slow walk animation or the apartment in the beginning of the game.\\nThe game is soulless, lacks beauty in any sense and is blatantly a hit piece on anyone not LGBT or progressive.\\nIt barely qualifies as a Video game.\",

I purchased it on an 80% sale @ $14 and this is WELL worth a $14 game.\\n\\nThe combat is fast paced, yet slightly janky... it's a dumbed down melee brawler derived from the Arkham series to allow for better designed and satisfying ranged combat. Traversal is reminiscent of Gotham Knights less the horrendous vehicle physics, the use of vehicles in this game are more polished and responsive.\\n\\nMetropolis is a beautifly designed city although you only effectively use a portion of it in game, giving a 1930/40's vibe as a tribute to the age DC comics originally came up with their heroes and also has a somewhat futuristic and multi-layered design.\\n\\nThe boss fights pose a challenge and have a much grander feel to fighting the front-line forces, however, it still doesn't feel like you're actually taking on the Justice League, more so their nerfed counter parts. (Except for Green Lantern early on because of well, plot armour)\\n\\nThe voice acting is well done and the story takes on a reasonable pace that keeps up with your level progression.\\n\\nMy positives for the game:\\n\\n1. Fast-paced gameplay that requires variety, yet does become tedious with all the mechanics involved.\\n2. Beautifully crafted city with limitless traversal\\n3. A wide selection of weapons and equipables to cater to one's preferred playstyle\\n4. The story of 4 miscreants with 0 chemistry being constantly back-stabbed is fitting, although some characters are just too much\\n5. Somewhat quick linear progression where the game tends to throw everything at you within the first few hours. Some people may not enjoy this.\\n6. There is a wide variety of missions that revolve around 3-4 basic tropes that you would find in a game like this that do throw different varieties of enemies at you to keep you on your toes.\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats:\\n\\n1. Captain Boomerang is annoying AF, I understand that it is his character, but, they could've toned this down just a bit\\n2. Deadshot is a whiny Karen, also could have been toned down\\n3. The skill trees don't allow for true character customisation as they should as you earn points that alternate between trees as you level up. You also only get a single perk to choose from at times which doesn't really give you that RPG feel that they were going for. However, some choices, when you do get them make drastic enough changes to your character. \\n5. Combat has a myriad of mechanics involved and can be a bit wonky at times\\n\\nOther than that, I was never expecting another game tied in to the Arkham lore, and Rocksteady did put monumental effort into making a fresh, new IP (and i feel that they were successful in doing so, yet the game itself was not well received), so, I'm not as butt-hurt as the majority of the fan base, nor am I too particularly happy about it being a live service game, but it is what it is.\\n\\nAll-in-all this is a genuine 7/10 game if you're going to focus on getting through the story. I would recommend picking it up between $10 - S20\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1726606955, 'timestamp_updated': 1726607144, 'title_vector': [0.018467215821146965,

Is this really a game developed by the developers of my beloved Arkham Series? \\n\\nThe game\\'s tutorial wanted me to return the title immediately but then I thought come on give it a try it cant be that bad. For starters: I bought that game on an 80% discount (19,99€). I dont even know where to start. Lets start with the combat. This game was made by the company who created the - in my opionion - best combat system in a superhero game -> the freeflow combat system; this system from the Batman Arkham games is till today superb and they exchanged that\\nwith this weirdly mess of shooter gameplay?... oh boi. \\n\\nbest part of my 2h session: introduction of Batman was amazing. Relatively after the Batman encounter you can walk threw \"The Batman Experience\" its basically a walkthrough \\nthrew all the iconic moments from the Arkham games and oh man did they give me a nostalgic kickback. all the cool characters, all the cool scenes and memories about the games.\\nIt seems almost like Suicide Squads wants to mock you and tell you \"this game will never be as good as those games...\".\\n\\nSo in the end, although I enjoyed some of the cutscenes, the gameplay loop killed it for me. It just wasn\\'t fun compared to their previous games. I was looking for a nice story, cool combat, cool traversal systems. \\n\\nIn the story sequences you get a hint that Rocksteady is still able to create and inscenate great story moments, but they gave it away to create a dull and stupid service game. \\n\\nI rarely leave a thumbs down review, but in this case I had no choice. Refunded after 2 hours and it wasnt even worth the 19,99€ I payed.\\n\\nI look on the bright side: hopefully this mess will be the reason that Rocksteady\\'s next game goes back to the roots.',

The combat is absolutely intense, especially on hard mode. It\\'s like facing a boss every time you\\'re up against a group of enemies. The graphics and gameplay are truly impressive. You must invest a minimum of 64 hours before forming an opinion. I strongly disagree with many critiques of this game because it\\'s genuinely excellent. You need to immerse yourself in it and feel the flow to truly appreciate it. The quests and spell upgrades are integral to the game, and the storyline is exceptional.

This game is recent, so this cannot be justified.\\n[*] The game still visual lags on a beast of a computer (i7-14700K, RTX 4070 SUPER). Despite getting 200 fps all the time, it doesn't feel like 200 fps [b]at all[/b]; rather, it feels like 45 to 75 fps on my 240 Hz monitor.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]Poor controls[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dodging doesn’t work sometimes, even when timed perfectly.\\n[*] There's a slight delay with parkour and controls in general, but that's not a huge issue compared to other problems.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]The game is an extremely remarkable and amazing idea that FAILS due to its issues[/h1]\\nIf not for these significant flaws, I would definitely finish this game multiple times. [b]The game would be addicting if everything worked properly.[/b] The poor implementation compromises the experience, leading to a disappointing 4/10 rating from me, despite its amazing concept.\\n\\n[b]In conclusion, it's a shame that such a good concept has been so poorly implemented, this is a massive lost potential of a game[/b]. With smooth performance and responsive controls, this game could easily be considered a masterpiece, scoring between 8/10 to 8.5/10.

The story isn\\'t as horrible as some made it out to be, not the best but had interesting points and there are a few characters i found myself caring for. The banter between Cuff and Frey while exploring adds a bit of fun too. A lot of people don\\'t like Frey but i think she builds into a better character overall as you progress though the game and she has grown on me as a character so far.\\r\\nMany people judged her only on the first few impressions they got of her, i understand first impressions are the best but if i placed myself in her shoes and if i was warped away to a different world and could control magic i\\'d possibly have a similar reaction. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot to explore, I find myself discovering all the different locations and doing the side missions before i move on. Each place you finish will make you a little stronger with new spells, gear, or stat increases.\\r\\nOverall the graphics are quite beautiful as well and there are some stunning locations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is very fun, you can dash, jump, flip, and everything else while fighting and shooting out spells and there is a nice collection of different ones you can use. You can also switch out spells while fighting at a press of a button making it so you can combo your spell or switch to a defensive spell if needed quick. It feels very fluid and mixing movement and attacking is pretty well done. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also can\\'t comment on any lag, stutters, or anything like that. I am able to run the game on ultra settings without issue. The only graphical \"\"issues\"\" are the fires and skybox (some areas) in the game are look very low res and can break immersion a bit with how out of place it can look. \\r\\nI also did not buy the game at release so i cannot comment on previous issues regarding that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think this game deserves the hate it gets and I really am enjoying it and truthfully the only thing i can say you shouldn\\'t do is buy it full price.\\r\\nWhile i\\'ve given the game a lot of praise the price is not what it should be at and i feel it should have been $40 to start. The game isn\\'t very long and while i am taking my time and exploring everything i see i am already about halfway though the game and taking my time and while i am having fun it\\'s the kind of game for me personally i will do everything i find fun, finish the main story/DLC story and then uninstall. This really feels like a 1 time play through type of game but something you should give a try. \\r\\n\\r\\nSadly there will not be a 2nd game or more added to this world and that makes me a bit sad. I feel like the devs could have made the 2nd game a lot better taking the feedback they were given with this but too much at launch and other issues made the studio close (Merged to work on different Square games iirc). \\r\\n', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 9, 'timestamp_created': 1727075267, 'timestamp_updated': 1727075267, 'title_vector': [-0.07209538668394089, -0.1020004004240036,

Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game’s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor’s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game’s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\\n\\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England—from the rolling hills of England’s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor’s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game’s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game’s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\n\\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware. However, Ubisoft has released several patches to address these concerns and improve the game’s stability.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is a monumental addition to the series, offering a captivating Viking adventure that blends historical intrigue with mythological elements. Its expansive open world, engaging combat, and deep RPG mechanics provide a robust and immersive experience. Despite some technical issues and a less pronounced focus on stealth, the game’s strengths make it a worthy journey for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Assassin’s Creed franchise. For those intrigued by Norse mythology, medieval history, and expansive RPGs, Valhalla delivers an epic and satisfying experience that stands out as one of the series' most ambitious entries.\\n\\n\",

Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game’s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor’s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game’s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\\n\\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England—from the rolling hills of England’s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor’s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game’s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game’s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\n\\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware. However, Ubisoft has released several patches to address these concerns and improve the game’s stability.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is a monumental addition to the series, offering a captivating Viking adventure that blends historical intrigue with mythological elements. Its expansive open world, engaging combat, and deep RPG mechanics provide a robust and immersive experience. Despite some technical issues and a less pronounced focus on stealth, the game’s strengths make it a worthy journey for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Assassin’s Creed franchise. For those intrigued by Norse mythology, medieval history, and expansive RPGs, Valhalla delivers an epic and satisfying experience that stands out as one of the series' most ambitious entries.\\n\\n\",

It is a bloated mess of chores with barely any actual game play with in. I thought the Egyptian and Greek assassin's creeds were bloated, this one take the cake. There is so much pointlessly fetch questing, fighting nameless enemies, and the assassinations mean entirely nothing. \\n\\nThe narrative ends with the leader of the order telling you that he was the one that left you all the clues to kill everyone else in his group. He then just walks away and tell you to trust that he won't do anything else anymore. Also, you could put a gun to my head and I wouldn't be able to name any major characters in the game since they're all just bit characters.\\n\\nTo give you an example of the pointlessness of some parts of the game. The river raiding segment of the game gives you resources that only upgrade the river raiding, which in turn lets you do more river raiding. Its a Sisyphean cycle of pointless grinding so that you can grind some more. I got the settlement to max level, its upgrades are pointless and meaningless, the power increase they give you is about as much as a few levels.\\n\\nI beat the main game, the Ireland DLC, the Ragnorok DLC and got a fair way through the France DLC.\\n\\nThe only part of any of these games that was mildly entertaining was the assassinations within the French DLC that actually had you making an event of the assassination.\\n\\nAbsolute waste of time, I'm going to reinstall BG3 now that patch seven is out and actually play something that is fun.\", 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 4,

One thing I took note of was the constant mixed reviews regarding the game play and the storyline that was given to the players which was repetitive and boring as compared to the earlier versions of Assassins Creed (E.g Black flag). So I decided to just play it with an unbiased view of the game as I have with other Assassins Creed games.\\n\\nHere's what I love about this game - \\n\\nThe Long History of the game: Although they were straying far (hack and slash, assassinations, and the likes) from the original feels from the older versions like AC Unity or Black flag (that includes the dual axe wielding, long list of abilities you get to pick, etc...). This game puts you through a very long and a very exciting history lessons about various mythologies, Vikings, Iceland, Finland and Others. Because of this, I would recommend anyone who hates to sit through boring history lessons in class and play this instead, albeit it has been modified to fit the games objective so you need to research on the actual history to be more accurate, but my point still stands that it is a great game to learn about the history of other countries and mythologies through this game alone.\\n\\nThe Graphics: My PC is well above the need to run this game at maximum graphics, but of course i wanted to save some VRAMs so that it runs smoothly, which made me put everything to High and Medium instead. Even so, the graphics on this game was amazing and immersive enough for me to not realize that I played for 3 hours (sometimes 5 if i really get myself into the character) without having the need to get off my computer and rest.\\n\\nThe MAIN STORYLINE: This does not include the other packages that comes with the complete edition and just the Valhalla version itself. It took me 60+ hours just to complete the main storyline and another 80+ hours to complete the other storyline. This MAY seem long (or short if you are a speed runner) but it's such an immersive game that I took my time to enjoy everything this had to offer. If I had bought this game without the complete version at the original price, this would have been worth my time and money.\\n\\nVariety of Skills and abilities: This game provided with so much skills (either from skill trees, runic skills, Item abilities, Hugr-wrist, Abilities) that will suit the players game play experience. Although this again, strays off the original concept of the older games, I will probably find it boring if they kept using the original concept with no innovation put to it. \\n\\nHere's what I don't like about the game - \\n\\nThe mechanics of the game: Back then the game mechanics were way more simpler and easier to understand (I play on keyboard and mouse), so learning the new mechanics of this game was complicated as there was alot of keybinds to remember, which sometimes cause me to press the wrong keybind and losing boss fights (especially with Sutr on Very Hard).\\n\\nThe Falling Death bug: There are times where I get stuck in a falling animation during battles which just kills me instantly to make me get unstuck, which is frustrating since I was already almost done with the quest. This definitely needs to be fixed but other then that, the game is good and does not affect my overall experience or opinions of the game.\\n\\nTLDR: If you love immersive, historic and amazing graphics at medium settings, buy the original version, i recommend it. If you do not like to pay for full price, wait for another huge discount like i did and buy the complete edition for $40++.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1726055901,

I absolutely love platforming and movement system. Exploration feels rewarding. Good environmental storytelling skeletons.\\n\\nI feel a lot of sympathy for both Nor and Enki, who is such a good companion - with his abilities, personality, and amazing animations. Also voice acting is truly fantastic for both of them.\\n\\nSo my only complain would be that game was sometimes dropping frames in the second part of the game, *BUT* 1) my processor is worse than suggested one in minimum requirement 2) it worked on Ubuntu, so that's on me.\\nAlso I wish it would has more options in photomode, cause capturing Nor and Venki was also very fun.\", 'voted_up':

first off I'll say I don't think the game is bad I like a lot of the character's abilities and all are unique the maps are well-designed as well the gun-play is also very tight some of the things I don't like even with a 3070 and 32gb of ram on NVME SSD this game is struggling to get 45FPS lots of stuttering even on a setup way above the recommended and while i enjoyed the 5 rounds i played its really not an easy buy at 40 dollars even more so when the game runs so poorly matchmaking times were personally between 1-3 minutes for brawl and on slot modes i didn't get a chance to try brawl but a really big problem i also came across was due to lack of skill based matchmaking my games kept going down the route of 5-30 with one team always being destroyed the team match-ups were not even at all and really affected game-play and was not fun came across no one with a mic and the game was lacking text chat so communication is basically not a thing if u don't have friends\", 'voted_up':

Even the purportedly climactic parts of this game are laughable. Gunfights are braindead if you try whatsoever. Yet 1/100 enemies will be a gunner who needs 5 clips to kill for some reason. One of like the 3 enemy types in this game. Loot is always the same. I think an enemy has thrown a grenade at me twice ever. Enemies are braindead. You can win a 20 v 1 with even a single tree as cover. I had to fire my GFH so i could even have fun shooting the minimal enemies (Which is the only fun you'll be having in this game.)\\nEnemy movements and reinforcements are predictable, slow, unnatural loud. Most outposts are disappointing. Missions feel like mmo missions not a AAA game with cool stuff and excitement. Random encounters are anticlimactic. No hunting practically. Most NPCs are annoying with cringe forced humor. Guns for hire say a cringe one liner every 20 seconds eliminating any atmosphere. Speakers with the bosses droning on with creepy cringe speeches that you cant turn off. Annoying music blasting in many areas. Enemy encounters feel dumbed down from previous titles. \\nLack of weapon variety. All enemies drive the same cars in the same fashion. Climbing towers is not fun. Missions don't feel exciting or natural like previous games. People you need to speak to are constantly interrupted. Frustrating forced encounters with un-skipable cutscenes. No NPC variety. If you are religious just put down your headset and get a drink when cutscenes start because it will make your skin crawl.\\nThe game tries to be sarcastically humerous, yet also tries heavy handedly to tug at your heartstrings, and tries to get you to fear enemies and hear these ridiculous tales of cruelty and violence, yet when you meet the enemy, it's just another of the same enemy you've been fighting the whole game. I think they stopped planning this game past the opening sequence because that is the only fun part of this game!

Played for awhile and during one of the daredevil stunt race missions, the vehicle kept spinning during the countdown and then starting me facing the wrong way.

The sun casts golden rays on the Aegean Sea, casting shimmering reflections that make you feel the Mediterranean's warmth. Each locale, from the dizzying heights of the Spartan mountains to the labyrinthine streets of Athens, is crafted with painstaking detail, capturing the rich tapestry of Greek civilization in stunning, evocative visuals.\\n\\nWhat sets Odyssey apart is its RPG elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the core Assassin’s Creed experience. The skill tree is vast and varied, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. Whether you want to whisper through the shadows as a silent assassin or charge headlong into battle as a fearsome warrior, the game supports your playstyle with a rewarding progression system.\\n\\nThe dialogues and choices offered throughout the game have weight and consequence, propelling you into a narrative that is deeply personal yet woven into the grand tapestry of the Peloponnesian War. The story branches in ways that feel organic and engaging, ensuring that no two journeys are the same. Every decision, from engaging in philosophical debates with Socrates to making pivotal choices about the fate of entire cities, shapes your legend in the game’s world.\\n\\nThe combat is a blend of precision and spectacle. Abilities such as the Spartan kick provide gleefully cinematic moments, while the parrying and dodging mechanics offer a satisfying challenge. The naval combat, a beloved element from previous games, returns with grander scale and strategic depth. Sailing the Aegean, engaging in ship battles, and diving for underwater treasures are all exhilarating experiences that add layers to the exploration.\\n\\nYet, it's the small details that truly elevate this game. The meticulously researched historical accuracy, the dynamic weather system, the ambient soundscapes that make every environment feel alive—these elements collectively immerse you in a way few games manage.\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed: Odyssey is a triumph, a grand tapestry of an era brought to life with passion and precision. It’s an adventure where every island, every myth, every choice adds to the epic saga that is your odyssey. If ever there was a game that proves the power of interactive storytelling, this is it. Highly recommended for both ardent history buffs and avid gamers alike.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1725432817, 'timestamp_updated': 1725432817, 'title_vector':

Story wise it was engaging and even the side missions were cool. Graphically looks decent and performance wise it ran great. Aside from the network issues with co-op lots of the time. Level gating to me made me enjoy it less unfortunately. Gameplay wise it was fine until you get to the point where you spam the X button to hit the people and it just gets boring. Also jumping/moving at all feels jank for me. Open world wise, not much happening there are crimes to do tho. It got pretty boring for me towards the end which is why I probably wouldn’t recommend it', 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'timestamp_created': 1725637929, 'timestamp_updated': 1725637929,

      "{'appid': '794540', 'timestamp_query': 1727643597, 'title': 'Neo Cab', 'recommendationid': '174022249', 'author.steamid': '76561197989390503', 'author.playtimeforever': 0, 'author.playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'author.playtime_at_review': 274, 'author.last_played': 1725145471, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'Giving it a thumbs up but with heavy reservations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeo Cab has us take a role of Lina, a cab driver in a neo-futuristic city. She\\'s just moved in to the city to live with her best friend from the past whom she hasn\\'t seen in ages. However, on the first night, her friend goes missing and Lina takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her friend and who is responsible while at the same time trying to make a living by driving passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a sense, Neo Cab is a hybrid of a visual novel story and management gameplay which involves serving customers, making enough money to get by, and making sure your star rating stays high. Normally, this kind of genre mixing can be risky, but what the game has is connected well enough, without either aspect getting in the way of the other. The story is giving us an end goal to strive towards, whereas the management aspect is giving us something to do and think about while we\\'re progressing through the plot. The gameplay isn\\'t complicated really and all you need to keep track of are your money and your rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile transporting customers, we get to learn a bit about them. They come in all kinds, the young and the old, the boring and the weird, the friendly and the hostile. Most (if not all) of them we get to meet multiple times throughout the game, so we get to know them really well and they could end up even helping us along during the main plot. In the way the customers are integrated into the game\\'s story is pretty decent because we do learn something from each of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the game loop is quite simple - you drive 3 customers per night, and occasionally visit some story-related location, then spend the night at a motel or one of those futuristic capsules, and then do the same the next night till six nights have passed. I personally was quite surprised how quickly and somewhat abruptly the game ended. I kind of expected it to go on for longer, with investigation taking more nights and requiring more tasks on our behalf, but it was pretty short and for many players might feel rather underwhelming. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe game\\'s world is interesting and tackles interesting subjects relating to the near future, particularly automation of the workforce and the ways in which corporations could use and abuse new technology for their own personal benefit. But the main plot of searching for your friend and uncovering what on Earth she got involved in fell rather short in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we interact with customers and any other characters, we often are given dialogue choices of what to say. This can impact how they feel about us and whether they would give us a good rating or share important information with us. One annoyance though that many other players seem to agree with is that the game often doesn\\'t let you pick the dialogue choices you want to pick, possibly because the character is not in the right mood or something, so they outright refuse to say what you tell them to say. And speaking of their mood - it seems to jump all over the place at the drop of a hat, and this can be very hard to keep track of, especially that most times it really isn\\'t clear how a particular dialogue branch will affect her mood. Most times you might as well just taking a wild guess at it (we can see how her mood gets changed due to a device she starts wearing on her wrist from early on in the game).\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphically the game is magnificent. In fact, the visuals are probably its biggest strength. The whole art style is very colourful, pleasing and in great style, fitting that neo-future aesthetic the game is going for. Coupled with decent background music in the style of synthwave, and the game is pretty enjoyable in its presentation. There is no voice acting here, which to some players may seem odd for a game like this, but to me personally it wasn\\'t a big deal as I just treated it as a visual novel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the save system could be vastly improved though. It isn\\'t clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn\\'t save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don\\'t see a reason why the game couldn\\'t just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn\\'t save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I\\'d say, if you\\'re not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you\\'re not missing out. If you are a fan of these things, then best to get it on a discount.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 14, 'timestamp_created': 1725227970, 'timestamp_updated': 1725227970, 'title_vector':

It's obviously written by Leigh Alexander and her narrative voice shines through.  The graphics are beautiful especially for something made in Unity.  The atmosphere and music is nice although it can be slow at times.  You're basically exploring the narratives of your customers which are delivered episodically.  The final emotional battle between Savvy and Lina owes a lot to the insult sword fights from Monkey Island.\\n\\nWorth playing if you've got it in your backlog and worth a buy if it's 85% off.  It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\\n\\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.  Suzerain and The Pale Beyond are both better as games than Neo Cab, but it's no slouch and worth a look.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1726577538, 'timestamp_updated':

It's obviously written by Leigh Alexander and her narrative voice shines through.  The graphics are beautiful especially for something made in Unity.  The atmosphere and music is nice although it can be slow at times.  You're basically exploring the narratives of your customers which are delivered episodically.  The final emotional battle between Savvy and Lina owes a lot to the insult sword fights from Monkey Island.\\n\\nWorth playing if you've got it in your backlog and worth a buy if it's 85% off.  It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\\n\\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.  Suzerain and The Pale Beyond are both better as games than Neo Cab, but it's no slouch and worth a look.\", 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'timestamp_created': 1726577538, 'timestamp_updated':

      "{'appid': '794540', 'timestamp_query': 1727643597, 'title': 'Neo Cab', 'recommendationid': '174022249', 'author.steamid': '76561197989390503', 'author.playtimeforever': 0, 'author.playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'author.playtime_at_review': 274, 'author.last_played': 1725145471, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'Giving it a thumbs up but with heavy reservations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeo Cab has us take a role of Lina, a cab driver in a neo-futuristic city. She\\'s just moved in to the city to live with her best friend from the past whom she hasn\\'t seen in ages. However, on the first night, her friend goes missing and Lina takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her friend and who is responsible while at the same time trying to make a living by driving passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in a sense, Neo Cab is a hybrid of a visual novel story and management gameplay which involves serving customers, making enough money to get by, and making sure your star rating stays high. Normally, this kind of genre mixing can be risky, but what the game has is connected well enough, without either aspect getting in the way of the other. The story is giving us an end goal to strive towards, whereas the management aspect is giving us something to do and think about while we\\'re progressing through the plot. The gameplay isn\\'t complicated really and all you need to keep track of are your money and your rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile transporting customers, we get to learn a bit about them. They come in all kinds, the young and the old, the boring and the weird, the friendly and the hostile. Most (if not all) of them we get to meet multiple times throughout the game, so we get to know them really well and they could end up even helping us along during the main plot. In the way the customers are integrated into the game\\'s story is pretty decent because we do learn something from each of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the game loop is quite simple - you drive 3 customers per night, and occasionally visit some story-related location, then spend the night at a motel or one of those futuristic capsules, and then do the same the next night till six nights have passed. I personally was quite surprised how quickly and somewhat abruptly the game ended. I kind of expected it to go on for longer, with investigation taking more nights and requiring more tasks on our behalf, but it was pretty short and for many players might feel rather underwhelming. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe game\\'s world is interesting and tackles interesting subjects relating to the near future, particularly automation of the workforce and the ways in which corporations could use and abuse new technology for their own personal benefit. But the main plot of searching for your friend and uncovering what on Earth she got involved in fell rather short in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we interact with customers and any other characters, we often are given dialogue choices of what to say. This can impact how they feel about us and whether they would give us a good rating or share important information with us. One annoyance though that many other players seem to agree with is that the game often doesn\\'t let you pick the dialogue choices you want to pick, possibly because the character is not in the right mood or something, so they outright refuse to say what you tell them to say. And speaking of their mood - it seems to jump all over the place at the drop of a hat, and this can be very hard to keep track of, especially that most times it really isn\\'t clear how a particular dialogue branch will affect her mood. Most times you might as well just taking a wild guess at it (we can see how her mood gets changed due to a device she starts wearing on her wrist from early on in the game).\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphically the game is magnificent. In fact, the visuals are probably its biggest strength. The whole art style is very colourful, pleasing and in great style, fitting that neo-future aesthetic the game is going for. Coupled with decent background music in the style of synthwave, and the game is pretty enjoyable in its presentation. There is no voice acting here, which to some players may seem odd for a game like this, but to me personally it wasn\\'t a big deal as I just treated it as a visual novel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the save system could be vastly improved though. It isn\\'t clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn\\'t save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don\\'t see a reason why the game couldn\\'t just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn\\'t save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I\\'d say, if you\\'re not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you\\'re not missing out. If you are a fan of these things, then best to get it on a discount.', 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 14, 'timestamp_created': 1725227970, 'timestamp_updated': 1725227970, 'title_vector':
