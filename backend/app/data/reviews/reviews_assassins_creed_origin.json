        "review": "Assassin's Creed Origins follows Bayek of Siwa on a breathtaking journey through ancient Egypt, blending history and myth with gorgeous visuals and captivating storytelling. The vast, open-world is rich with detail, from the sunlit deserts to the streets of Alexandria, offering a deep sense of exploration and discovery. Bayek is driven by personal loss and a desire for justice, making his journey emotionally engaging. Both expansions of AC Origins, 'The Hidden Ones' and 'The Curse of the Pharaos', breathe new life into Bayek's journey, expanding his world with depth and wonder, making his story even more unforgettable. Overall, Origins is a beautifully crafted experience that no one should pass up on",

They are very eager to pump up the users of Ubisoft Connect that they don't even know that its back firing. Tell me, what is the necessity of the Uplay App? I don't even have friends in your platform, I only have friends here in Steam so I don't see the point why I need to run your lame app in order to play this game? It is very hassle to me because Uplay doesn't run properly. Once I close the game and run it again the Uplay will bugged out and I need to reinstall that shitty app every time I play so that's why I decided to refund the game here in Steam so that I can buy other games that don't require 3rd party software in order to play the game. Shame on you UBISOFT!!!",

I didnt care for the story, the start is slow and boring, but after awhile the story actually does get better and better. Ending with one of the best endings in the series. They also kept the momentum going with 2 high quality DLCs, which were by far my favorite parts of the game.\nThe worst part of the game is the level system, if you go 30 seconds into a region that has enemies higher level than you, you get 1 shot by literally all enemies. The system sucks and it locks you out of exploring. Even the story missions has a recommended level, which forces you into doing garbage for hours. The sidequests were boring for the most part so I just skipped a lot of them, but the DLC ones were surprisingly good.\nAll in all worth playing just for the ending & the DLCs, without a doubt the best one since Black Flag",

Now, don't get me wrong, this game still carries a lot of faults including the new combat system, which despite offering a refreshing approach of freedom can be infuriatingly inconsistent at times (I advise anyone to begin this game on the easy setting to start with. You can change the difficulty at any point you feel you need more of a challenge from the combat) but this game gave me everything I ever realistically expected as an AC fan and the game delivers so much choice and option to tailor your preferred experience of it.\r\n\r\nThe series is finally given the overhaul it desperately needed and this flourishes all the better for it and it's difficult to pick an aspect of it that fails to entertain. I've loved every minute of it. I'm a little biased with the setting, I admit, due to my love for ancient Egypt but it felt a perfect location to kick start the creed and in many ways I see this game as a reimagining or even a reboot of the series as much as a prequel. It's root influence is Black Flag providing plenty of stalking zones for stealth. Chuck in some HZD, a pinch of the Witcher and an overall feel of the original Tomb Raider (In my personal top 5 of all time) and you essentially have the components that make this game what it is.\r\n\r\nBayek, the lead character, is briliantly portrayed and a massive improvement on the cardboard cutouts from previous installments and his altruism propels you through a gargantuan story which is nothing short of epic in scope charting the power struggle in Egypt for thier independance from Romans, Greeks and thier own Pharaohs. The more I played, the more I liked and the further up the AC ladder it got. In fact, I think I have a new favourite. Thank you, Ubisoft (Never thought i'd say that...)",

From the very first moment, you're immersed in a vibrant world filled with historical detail, stunning landscapes, and engaging characters.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, Bayek, is one of the most compelling heroes in the series.

Whether you're exploring bustling cities like Alexandria, scaling the majestic Pyramids of Giza, or wandering through the vast deserts, the attention to detail is breathtaking. The dynamic weather, lighting, and wildlife bring the world to life in a way that few games manage to achieve.\r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, \"Origins\" introduces a refined combat system that feels fluid and responsive. The RPG elements, with skill trees and customizable gear, add depth to the experience, allowing you to tailor Bayek\u2019s abilities to your playstyle. The side quests are well-crafted, offering meaningful stories that are more than just filler content, further enriching the game\u2019s world.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of ancient tombs, solving puzzles, and uncovering the mysteries of the First Civilization are incredibly satisfying for fans of both history and the series\u2019 lore. The Discovery Tour mode is a fantastic addition, offering a unique educational experience that makes Ancient Egypt even more accessible.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\" is a triumphant return for the franchise.

I completed Unity and i must say that Unity is a better assassin game, i prefer the combat mechanism there, and you dont get as much fancy tools and weapon in Unity (simplicity is the best, and no i did not unlock any extra consumable tools in Origins' skill tree).\n\nBut, Origins is a good game too, maybe not so much as an assassin game, it's a mix of open world RPG and assassin game.\nYou can still play like a assassin or going SPARTAAAA, but overall 'assassin' style gameplay is quite easy... im playing Origins in normal diff and i find it (infiltrating and stealth killing) easier than Unity. Personally, I find the close combat quite clunky, but is still acceptably good.\n \nOrigins got better plot that I can very well immerse myself in. You can feel the angers and sadness from them characters. There are quite a lot of side quests and there are, well, similarities at times but not totally repetitive.\n\nMinor bug is when in rocky area with uneven surfaces, you can easily get stuck and having a hard time running around. Another thing is that the level mechanism making you dealing little to no damage to high level enemies while they can kill you in 2 attacks. Well that in the end it does not matter.",

        "review": "Despite being seven years old, the game's graphics are really good. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's good enough to make me grow attached to the characters\u2014at least most of the time. The open world feels immersive and meaningful, avoiding the trap of being filled with pointless side quests (although I mainly focused on the main story).\n\nAs a fan of the original Assassin's Creed games, I found this title strikes a solid balance between RPG elements and classic AC gameplay. While I encountered a few bugs (like ships or enemies popping out of nowhere and getting stuck), none of them were game-breaking. However, the level scaling of enemies sometimes felt bad, as it could take an absurd number of hits to defeat them. I think playing on the max difficulty probably contributed to that too!\n\nOverall, the game feels like a prototype for AC Odyssey on the RPG side of things. If you find the game on discount, it's definitely worth picking up. I'll share more thoughts on Odyssey in a separate review after finishing the story.",

        "review": "-------------------\nUbisoft is evil\n-------------------\n\nSTOP GIVING your money to Ubisoft. In the latest patch, in 2024, Ubisoft suddenly deleted Heka Chests, the player-friendly lootboxes purchased using 3000 INGAME gold PURPOSELY. After finishing the main game, 2 DLCs, i installed a previous version reverting mod from Nexus called \"Restore Heka Chests\". Got really cool weapons but they're useless because i already beat the game.\n\nNo buying helix credits too, they shut down the store. Using 700 helix credits from season pass, I spent them on the First Civilization Pack and Swordfish weapon during the 50% sale. wait for that before you spend the helix credits to get the best value. \n\n---------------\nCensorship\n---------------\n\nAfter using Photo Mode and taking photos of nude women (yes i admit it's weird), the game stops sending me the latest event quests \"Trial of the Gods\" where one fights 3 Egyptian gods Sobek, Anubis and Sekhmet.\n\nDon't you think it's really stupid to shadowban a player for just using an ingame feature? I did not mod the game, the nudity is there BY DEFAULT.\n\n------------\nDifficulty\n------------\nStarted my game on Normal. but later switched to Nightmare for the main game's final arc. Nightmare enemies are very dangerous especially animals, they are immune to stunning and can keep attacking. Leopards can easily destroy you. For human enemies, just spam Smoke Screen or keep dodging and use cursed weapons. Cursed weapons give you 200% more damage but forces your hp to 33%, worth it.\n\nSmoke Screen is usable even when dodging, which gives you time to assassinate enemies before they even detect you.\n\nFor the best experience, Hard difficulty is best. the more advanced AI is only active in Hard or Nightmare. Hard is good for the average person who doesn't enjoy dying too often.\n\n--------------\nGameplay\n--------------\n\nCompared to the previous game AC syndicate, The combat is really good. Bayek is best with a Normal Sword, Sickle Sword and Spear. His attacks feel forceful and fierce. Not recommended to use axes, clubs or staffs, these weapon types are bad. Sleep darts put opponents to sleep and Smoke Screen stun opponents. It makes you invisible. use while staying still and BEHIND COVER, before enemy sees you.\n\n\nOverpower attacks are the most fun mechanic because you can reliably 1HKO enemies or severely injure them. the shield helps to block arrows, in the past AC games \"AC Unity\", Ranged Enemies kill you easily. a shield fixes the problem.\n\nArchery is awesome. Predator bows: high damage and high range. Light bows: good for chipping enemies. Hunter bows is balanced. Warrior bow is a shotgun but too situational, wastes arrows too easily. It requires 2 perks and a headshot to deal good damage.\n\n------------------\nEnvironment\n------------------\n\n\"I don't like sand\" - Anakin Skywalker. Many places are boring and ugly. Egyptian temples are the main attractions, they are the coolest structures. This game takes place during Old Egypt's final days. The Pharaohs are Greeks. Bayek and his Egyptian people are the target of systemic racism from the Greeks. I'm depressed to see Egypt falling apart.\n\n-----------\nParkour\n-----------\n\nMUCH BETTER than AC Unity and Syndicate's parkour but worse than AC1 to AC Rogue. Parkour is more dangerous again because you can accidentally fall to death, higher realism contrasting AC Unity & AC Syndicate.\n\n-------------------\nAchievements\n-------------------\nAchievements are really simple except for 2.\n\n1) Archeologist: \"Complete all tours in the Daily Life category\" I REALLY HATE that Ubisoft forced the player to finish 20 tours for 1 silly achievement.\n\n2) Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: \"Sell 100 trinkets at once.\" ONE MUST sell 100 unnecessary items AT ONCE to get this achievement, it means losing out some gold for early game to upgrade your weapons. ANIMAL GOODS DO NOT COUNT.\n\nGot all 67 achievements, 162 hours.",

When I love the game, I tend to do all the side missions. I haven't finished the game yet, but I want to take a moment to praise this game's side content. I understand that the game restricts main missions when you're under-leveled. It didn't impact me much because I found the side content compelling, and most of it ties into the main story. What's even more surprising in Origins is that some of the side missions have mo-cap performances, and some even feature their own corridor assassination sequences, something that cannot be said for the more recent games in the franchise.\n\nMany others have said they find it annoying that they can't assassinate some enemies with a single strike; however, it's not as bad as many claim. The only characters I couldn't assassinate with one strike were the bounty hunters. Other than that, I was always able to finish off any enemy with one hidden blade strike.\n\nThe last thing I want to address is the story and music: they are amazing and beautiful. Bayek might be my favorite AC protagonist ever, and the voice actor did a tremendous job. Overall, I love the game. It's my favorite AC game since Black Flag. 9.5/10.",

        "review": "By all metric, this is the last \"good\" AC game and here is why:\n\n1. The story still cares! Yeah I know! An AC game that actually respects the lore, and tries to set something up. Unlike the clusterf**k that is Odyssey and the brainrot that is Valhalla, Origins' story remains grounded in history and paints an interesting portrait of a character that is still beloved by the community. While the origin of the creed does not come about until the DLC releases the base game story is still for the most part carried by believable characters, dialogues and world events. I'd say do the side quests for as much as possible because they too help flesh out the narrative.\n\n2. The gameplay is basic, streamlined. But put into the proper context, this is the first game in the series that lets you soft roleplay by picking and choosing between different types of gear. It features a dynamic open world full of things you can do and interact with. While in retrospect it did kickstart a regression in the franchise in terms of animation, writing, movement and world-design quality, when this game came out it felt like a breath of fresh air after almost a decade of playing the same game set in the same cities. Considering it to be the \"last\" proper game in the franchise almost turns it into a kind of reward that you get for sticking with the franchise for so long. It is a love letter to the franchise as much as it is an attempt at trying something new.\n\n3. The world is simply something to behold. I love the colour palette, the varied looks of ancient Egypt depending on which region you are in. I love the Graeco-Roman cities full of NPCs doing things. I almost wish I hadn't played Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage because so much of those games were just copied-and-pasted assets from Origins. And you can't \"unsee\" what had been copied and pasted which cheapens the entire experience of playing Origins. We thought it was the beginning of something marvellous and edificial...turns out, by the time we got our hands on Origins, Ubisoft had already reskinned this game into two other versions slated to come out in the next 5 years.\n\nUltimately I like the game for what I remembered it to be, a new spin on an old franchise and formula that in 2017 was desperately in need of a soft reboot. What it ends up becoming, however, is something that saddens me as a longtime AC fan, but also, entirely unexpected.",

This is not bad, just as a matter of fact. \n\nI was enjoying exploring ancient Egypt, though to the end I was freaking hating these outposts.  Too many repetitivity for my liking. If not for my strange decision to 100% the game I'd probably not be bored to the end. \n\nThe story is lovely and I'm very pleased with the main character. I can feel Bayek, his motives and I undertsand why he is making this or that decision. Really worth the time and money spent on it.",

They even removed a quests to get weapons that would normal be cash purchase for free due to what ever bs reason they want to give us.  Save your money and just say no or play for the story.

YES! it did, the game introduces the beautiful terrains of Egypt from roaming the desserts and its pyramids, walking around the city of Alexandria and exploring hidden temples. Assassin creed origins delivered on how the RPG system works on the franchise while still maintaining the Assassin creed identity, unlike Odyssey and Valhalla... The game itself is beautiful and I love how the game feels authentic and historically accurate which made the game more fun and better and I might say this is by far one of the great AC game and personally my favorite on the franchise and the very last GREAT AC GAME.

The result is boredom and confusion. The characters are just not that interesting. Far too many quests force you to walk slowly beside someone until you are then free to go. Bad development decisions poisoned what could have been a far more enjoyable game. No doubt they are still with the studio so it will continue project after project. \r\n \r\nUbisoft needs better writers and directors for their games. There are far too many fetch quests which always need 3 things and then return. Hiring actual children actors would work much better than using women who clip their voices and pretend to be young. Their voices will start to get on your nerves every time you enter a location and hear their same lines. \r\n\r\nThe two DLCs were well done in part but suffer in one way or another. Get them and the base game on sale. I can't imagine who paid full price for this slop and walked away thinking it was great. It's a 6 out of 10 game for me and a slightly raised thumbs up.",

For the campaign, at first the start is slow and boring, but after awhile the story actually does get better and better. Ending with one of the best endings in the series. The DLC is actually very good too, especially the Hidden Ones who put the first foundation as The Assassin to fight and prevent the Order of the Ancients before transitioning to The Templars, the cons are the price, only buy this game when discounted, and the grindiness of the leveling the character and weapons.",

It took me right back to the feels I had when Ezio found Altair's body in the library. I'm not exaggerating when I say I loved every bit of it. The setting, the massive world to explore, the side quests, it was all top-notch!\r\n\r\nThat said, the ending did feel a bit rushed, like most AC games. I was really hoping we'd get to assassinate Cleopatra since she turned out to be such a backstabber. Exploring the pyramids and those creepy, dark tunnels was a blast too.\r\n\r\nIt hit me hard when Bayek and Aya had to part ways to start their own brotherhood, and it's even sadder knowing they end up buried in the same cave! Their love story was one of my favorite parts. I also wish we got more time playing as Layla in the present-day scenes.\r\n\r\nStill have the DLCs to dive into, but overall, this game was 100% worth it!",

As in the next parts of this series, the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive consisting of the same tasks over and over again.\n\nThe redeeming features are game's setting in Egypt, which is kinda cool, and, of course, graphics.\n\nP.S.

SO THERE SHOULD BE NO HATE REGARDING THIS GAME SAYING THAT ''OLD AC GAMES VS NEW AC GAMES ''[/b]\n[u] THIS IS AS MUCH AC GAME AS IT SHOULD BE [/u]\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN ----\nGAME MAP - 80 SQKM VS AC BLACK FLAG 145 SQKM . SO NO NEW OPEN WORLD THEORY.\nSHOP - JUST LIKE AC 2 OR BROTHERHOOD, DIFFERENT SELLER NOT LIKE ODYSSEY\nARMOUR -  NOT SO RPG , JUST LIKE ANY PREVIOUS AC GAME WHERE SPECIAL PARTS CAN BE UPGRADED BUT OUTFIT DOESN'T.\nMAP LEVEL - JUST LIKE SYNDICATE\nWEAPON -  KINDA LIKE UNITY \nUI SOUND - MIX OF PREVIOUS AC GAMES\n\nREVIEW -  I SAID BEST BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS OF THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS PERFECT FOR HISTORY LOVER. THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SET IS PERFECT.ALL PREVIOUS AC GAMES DID GOOD ABOUT THIS BUT THIS GAME DID WAY BETTER.YOU CAN INSTANTLY FEEL THAT YOU ARE IN THAT ERA.(I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT I WAS IN ANCIENT INDIA SPECIALLY BENGAL). BUILDING STRUCTURES, ROOFS, CORP FIELDS,EARTHEN ROADS, MUD HOUSES.TEMPLES,MARKETS.\nAND OVERALL EGYPT...THEY CREATED THAT TIME AS NEARLY PERFECT AS THEY COULD. EVEN IN EMPTY DESSERT , I CAN WALK FOR ETERNITY.\n\nFIGHTING, ARMOURS, WEAPONS - NOT SO GREAT BUT NOT BAD EITHER,IN ONE WORD YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED \n\nSTORY AND CHARACTER - I WON'T REVEAL FOR SPOILER BUT ...DAMN GOOD ...NEED SEQUEL ...AND THE CHARACTER....WE SAW THAT TYPE AFTER LONG TIME...AND YOU CAN EASILY COUNT HIM ON TOP TIER AMONG OTHER ASSASSINS\n\nGRAPHICS - AS 2017 GAME IT IS BEAUTIFUL . 9/10 RATING ON 2024 STANDARD.(MAX SETTINGS)\nI PLAYED AND COMPLETED THIS GAME TWICE (CRACK+BUY) ON HARDEST DIFFICULTY AND TOOK MY TIME. I DIDN'T FIND ANY GAME BREAKING BUG OR GLITCH.\n\nDLC- DECENT STORY AND GOOD ADDITION\n\nTOUR GUIDE - 10/10. BEST ADDITIONAL FEATURES FOR ME. REALLY LIKED IT\n\nSOUNDTRACK - 9/10 , SPECIALLY EZIO THEME ON MENU AND MAIN OST IS JUST AWESOME \n\nIF YOU STILL HATE THIS GAME FOR JUST BEING IN THE NEW AC LIST . PLEASE PLAY AGAIN AND GIVE SOME TIME TO THIS GAME , I ASSURE YOU THIS GAME DOES NOT DESERVE THAT HATE WHICH ORIGINATE PROBABLY FROM ODYSSEY OR VALHALLA\n\nTIP - IF YOU LIKE TO ENJOY THE GAME WORLD THEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN MISSION , TRY TO WALK SLOWLY (EASIER WITH CONTROLLER) INSTEAD OF RUNNING. YOU WILL FIND A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF THAT WORLD.\n\n",
