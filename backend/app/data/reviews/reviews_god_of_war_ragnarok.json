        "review": "[h1]Good Overall, but something is funky with the performance[/h1]\n\nLook, it's God of War, Ragnarok. It's a good game--you've probably seen the reviews for the PS5 and PS4 version. It's got great combat, a great story, great graphics--the whole nine yards. \n\nI'm enjoying it so far, but as far as a PC port goes, there's... something not quite right. \n\nI have a fairly powerful PC (RTX 4070 TI, 5800x3D), and the overall framerate, even at native resolution (1440p) with DLAA enabled is good, but there's clearly some kind of issue with frame pacing. The average framerate is around 100 fps, in most scenarios--which is pretty darn good, especially for a single player game--but it just feels... [i]off[/i]. Stuttery and jerky, unsmooth despite an, on paper, rock solid framerate. \n\nIt seems to be related to two issues--the above mentioned frame pacing issue (something also shown by MSI afterburner, on my pc), as well as the fact that my monitors VRR just. Doesn't work properly with this game? It sometimes reduces the refresh rate, as it's supposed to, but most of the time it's stuck at the max value--240 hz. \n\nThere's possibly an issue with the latest Nvidea driver--reinstalling the driver seemed to fix this issue, at least at first, but I played the game again today and it was still an issue. The only solution was capping the frame rate--80 fps seems to work okay, and fits within my monitor's native refresh rate. \n\nOverall, it's good, and I'm rating it as good, but the performance issues are disappointing.",

        "review": "to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\n\nI\u2019m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\n\nEDIT : there\u2019s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!",

After navigating to the Playstation website and was routed through the problem FAQ's to contact customer service. Customer service connected me with a chatbot, which then got stuck in a loop informing me that customer service was not available at this time, despite being within operating hours, which it also provided. \n\nAfter several more attempts and an apparent alignment of supernatural forces, I was able to convince the chatbot to place me in the queue to live chat with an agent. At time of writing my position was well over 100 from being able to chat. All this to recover an account for a service I do not want, to play a game that I have purchased through a separate service. \n\nThis review will not change unless the PSN requirement is removed from the game.",

The game is spectacular, it's just one of THOSE GAMES where you just want to forget everything the second you are done with the game just so you can play it for the first time again. I love the series, love the story, love the characters and especially creatures in the game. Also the DLC although kinda repetitive, still fun for a few hours and it's free so yeah. No horrible performance issues either = my mouse stopped working once (restart fixed it), dropped frames few times (it was for a few seconds so i'm cool with it), and my game dropped once (i have 72 hours and my game dropped ONCE) so idk what everyone else is talking about but it's in the state of playable for sure and jesus giving negative review because of PSN accounts when it's so easily avoidable is just annoying, the same way Sony is with forcing it on people. As I said before, go have fun with it!!\n\nOkay I usually make reviews after 100%ing the game, but this time I can't help myself but give it now because I feel like most of the negative reviews are either due to the PSN accounts (which don't get me wrong, it does really suck but I don't think the game deserve the hate for something Sony does, it's not fair to the people that gave it hundreds of hours creating, they really did not make that stupid decision) and the other ones are because of optimization? I did not stumble upon any big issues regarding that, if I don't count one boat floating in the air lmao. I had chills playing this game from the first minute, I can't wait what's ahead of me and these negative reviews should not make you reconsider buying the game.

That's a terrible argument and a completely unreasonable expectation. Stop making excuses for bad consumer practices. L corpo bootlicking.",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been happily playing since launch on my steam deck. Despite having a PSN account I\u2019ve never been asked to login. I didn\u2019t want to mess around with FSR 3.1, I capped my game at 30fps and it has been consistent. Despite its name, low settings looks great and I only had the game crash once; this is better optimised than 2018.\n\nIf you absolutely fell in love with 2018 like me, then I think the gameplay improvements will have you hooked. I like Kratos\u2019s moveset, I like the weapon changes and additions, I like that all gear is viable now thanks to crafting. Instead of 3 boss fights in 2018, Ragnarok has at least 30+ and I liked (nearly) all of them. At some points you play as Artreus and I like his increased mobility and bow combat in short bites.\n\nThe story is really bad and very predictable. It feels too safe, it also feels too messy. It lacks the care and thought 2018 had. Gods don\u2019t talk like gods anymore, everyone talks like a Marvel superhero, and a LOT of out-of-character can be heard, especially from Kratos. I thought they had the Norse story planned from the beginning but evidently not, I derived zero satisfaction from this tale and all the questions I had led to boring answers. Mimir went from my faviourte character to an annoyance and I think they forgot he\u2019s meant to be the smartest man alive.\n\nUltimately I enjoyed my time with the game thanks to the gameplay and I think you get your moneys worth in terms of content but as a sequel to 2018\u2019s game of the year; it really blunders.",

The thing is my brother lives in a country where this game is blocked to be purchased on Steam by Sony. Let me repeat myself - Steam platform is legal and supported in that country, but Sony said Valve to block their new games from said country. There is absolutely no reason to do this. No justification. I understand Sony is blocking some countries from their own platform - PSN for reasons, but telling Valve to block countries that Steam supports for any other game except all upcoming Sony published games is just complete disaster. My brother has even bought most of previous Sony games that are still to this day available on Steam for purchase, but all of a sudden all newly released and upcoming single player games are blocked.\nThe dumbest part is that my brother was forced to move to one of EU countries, not some jungle or desert in middle of nowhere, it is EU country and Sony forced Valve to block the country for absolutely no reason from buying some single player games.\nThis is just wrong, very very wrong!",

        "review": "[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\n\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\n\nI played God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnar\u00f6k delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\n\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \n \nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnar\u00f6k is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn\u2019t make it a mere DLC. There\u2019s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\n\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \n\nThe gameplay in Ragnar\u00f6k is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There\u2019s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnar\u00f6k improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnar\u00f6k is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don\u2019t feel like chores; they\u2019re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it\u2019s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can\u2019t complain since it\u2019s free.\n\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\n\nThere\u2019s an undeniable feeling that Ragnar\u00f6k leans into a more woke tone. This isn\u2019t just a personal opinion. There\u2019s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\n\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about one of the game\u2019s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnar\u00f6k introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnar\u00f6k tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnar\u00f6k struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \n\n[h3]Graphics \u2013 A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \n\nVisually, Ragnar\u00f6k is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game\u2019s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnar\u00f6k had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn\u2019t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\n\n[h3]Music \u2013 Less Memorable[/h3]  \n\nSurprisingly, I didn\u2019t enjoy Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnar\u00f6k didn\u2019t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018\u2019s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I\u2019ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s music outside the game.\n\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn\u2019t Elevate[/h3]\n  \nOverall, I feel like there\u2019s not much more to say about God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. The game\u2019s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I\u2019ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnar\u00f6k is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn\u2019t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\n\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\n\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page \u269c\ufe0f[/URL]",

Great work of Santa Monica Studio.\n\nSpoiler [spoiler] Not a fan playing as Atreus. He's got great moves and fun combat, but the Ironwood level was too long and boring in most parts. [/spoiler]\n\nAs for PSN account, I've had one before, so it took me literally a few seconds to log in. Not sure how the process goes for those who do not have any accounts, but the fact that it is required in order to play a singleplayer game sucks.\n\nGreat game tho.",

The combat is near identical save for a few tweaks to how effective the Runic Attacks are and some new added skills and abilities. The story is very good and engaging, the side quests are also not a chore to complete so exploration is fun. The issue I've had comes with the game crashing every now and then. It'll freeze up and crash maybe once every 2 hours or so, which should not be happening considering my PC specs are well above the minimum requirements for the game. I don't have this issue with any other modern games so I can only assume something is happening with Ragnarok specifically. It can be annoying but it auto-saves frequently and doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but for a full price AAA game, I still find it unacceptable.",

At first I didn't care having to create a PSN account, since in my region it is available. Anyway as soon as I started the game and had to log in to said PSN account it kept infinitely looping between me having to sign in and the default screen where you can either continue to the sighn-in page or quit the game. Any actions in trying to repair the files and re-installing the game have unfortunately failed. The PSN support, if you can call it that has also failed to provide a feasible solution. Only stating that it should work after the file verification.\n\nSo I chose to refund this product which leaves me disappointed, since I was looking forward to playing this game. Guess if they didn't choose to implement that PSN requirement, just as they didn't in the previous GOW everything would've worked fine.",

Ive had to restart my COMPUTER more than 3 times and ive barely gotten into the game. At some points you can get massive stuttering, or better yet if you use a controller it will essentially \"desync\" after about 30 minutes of playing where your inputs get a nice 2-4 second delay. \n\nAudio cutting in and out, I've had to reload checkpoints due to gamebreaking bugs on the very first mission, and the fact that some boxes wont let you open them.\n\nWouldnt buy this right now, wait until they patch the garbage out. I played the PS4 god of war about a year after it came out on PC so this is a little shocking for things to be in this much disarray.\n\nSmall Edit: About 60% of the VRAM issues have been solved, which makes the input lag glitch take about 50 minutes to start instead of 20. still could use some performance increases. I've seen some research online that having issues with bluetooth controllers may be a windows thing, not the game. We'll have to see. ",

        "review": "after hearing so many negative things about ragnarok, having 100%ed the game now i have to say. glad i didnt listen and played it myself. game is peak, combat is a massive improvement over the first, the realms are more fleshed out then in the first game. the story while not being as tightly written as the first is still awesome, a good finale story to end off the norse saga. my only big negative of the game is the countless walk and talks and atreus secions. they end up making the game harder to replay then the first and replayablity is a big important thing to me. the added roguelike mode does help with this but even it has some things i dont like, the patheing for it is 3 fights, a valhalla chose fight then a boss, then a greek arena to do a couple fights then a tyr fight. really wish they added an infinite mode for it cause when i wana hop in and do that comabt it would of been perfect.\r\n\r\nbut yea to give my final thoughts, game good go play it.",

        "review": "God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018's Santa Monica's - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \n\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \n\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\n\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \n\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \n\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \n\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\n\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \n\u26abThe story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\n\u26abNot a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\n\u26abThe combat is so damn fluent just like 2018's GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos's Spartan reflexes.\n\u26abThe boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I'm going to mention!!)\n\u26abFighting giant mythological mini-boss's that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \n\u26abThe soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\n\u26abChristopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That's not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead's Omega).\n\u26abThere is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\n\u26abIn any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\n\u26abThe graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \n\u26abYou can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018's GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \n\u26abThe attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\n\u26abThe old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \n\u26abThe puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\n\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\n\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it's origins and it's future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it's kind!\n\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]",

Pressed play, got a black screen briefly and then the game loaded.\n\nNow for people who want to know if this runs on the steam deck. I'm currently getting between 30-45 fps, low settings, AMD FSR 3.1 balanced , vsync off, fps limit off. Steam deck settings I've now locked the fps here as leaving it at 90fps I found it was a bit choppy. I've locked it to 36 fps and 1 hour in the game feels pretty damn smooth.\n\nEdit: after playing further into the game when reaching svartalfheim there was a pretty big tank in performance on the steam deck. Upon entering svartalfheim I got roughly 25-30 fps some times dropping to 20 fps, however, after reaching the free roam area via boat the performance increased. I am actually able to play AMD FSR Quality between 30-45 fps I've now unlocked the refresh rate via steam deck settings and it is smoother than when I previously locked  it to 36fps.

Demanding an account sign up is just ridiculous and completely unnecessary. You're literally losing sales from players all over the world who want to play this otherwise amazing game. You're also making it difficult for paying customers on Steam Deck and Linux to play this game on the platform of their choice. You were gaining so much good will before with your PC ports. Gamers were literally double dipping and buying your games twice just to play on PC, but you've absolutely squandered that good will with the PSN requirement.

This game will fuck you RAW after you get done installing this bloated fat fuck game for 4 hours. Sorry I didn't realized I needed to make 6 figures a year to run a game the ps5 shitblock can fart out. I checked when they first released the spec requirements that I had the minimum. I should be running this at high quality but instead I'm cockblocked by vram error messages. Why the fuck did they approve my gpu when it doesn't have enough vram to run it? Fuck the idiots who made this port, and fuck the other idiots who made the requirement list.\n\nI love this game so much why would they do me like this. I preordered when they first allowed and now I'm considering refunding unless they fix this asap.",

Also steam seems to have a issue with closing the game where although the game process has fully ended, steam still shows the game is running, and it will not reset until i hard restart steam. But overall the game is excellent and no there is no playstation account requirement, its just in there if you want to use it. It is optional.",
