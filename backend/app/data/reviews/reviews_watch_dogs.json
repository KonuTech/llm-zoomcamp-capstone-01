When we compare it to other watch dogs, watch dogs 1 and bad blood hold the best story writing. The game does show its age with time but still enjoyable even in 2024. gameplay is really nice but shooting and driving are not the best. After an hour or so u will get used to it though. Best playable on 60 fps, if u play on 120 fps u will run into some issues during elevator animation and few places here and there. But still my favourite watch dogs in the series.",

The only thing i would complain about, is the lack of attention to the driving physics - i would compare it to driving a car in a ice rink and their response to collisions, well they're dog shit - crowbcat did an excellent job to show how terrible the collisions in this game in general. <you can check out his video out in yt ;)>\n\n8.9/10\n\n\n",

        "review": "Watch_Dogs, developed by Ubisoft, is an open-world action-adventure game that introduces players to the world of cyber warfare and surveillance. Set in a near-future version of Chicago, players control Aiden Pearce, a skilled hacker who uses his abilities to manipulate the city\u2019s infrastructure via a central operating system (ctOS) while seeking revenge for a personal tragedy. The game is a unique blend of hacking, stealth, and traditional open-world combat, providing a fresh twist on the genre.\n\nThe standout feature of Watch_Dogs is its hacking mechanics, which allow players to control traffic lights, cameras, and even power grids to outsmart enemies and solve missions. The game also offers fluid driving mechanics, dynamic combat, and a diverse array of side activities, from criminal investigations to mini-games like poker. However, despite its innovative ideas, the game sometimes feels weighed down by its somewhat generic protagonist and a narrative that lacks the emotional depth it aims for. In addition, the world can feel underutilized, as many of the side missions fall into repetitive patterns.\n\nPros:\n\n-Innovative hacking mechanics that add depth to gameplay.\n-Expansive and detailed open-world Chicago.\n-Diverse set of side activities and mini-games.\n\nCons:\n\n-Main story and protagonist feel underdeveloped.\n-Repetitive side missions and objectives.\n-Hacking mechanics can become overly simplified over time.\n\nOverall, Watch_Dogs presents a fresh and creative take on the open-world genre, especially for players who enjoy technological themes and hacking. While it doesn\u2019t fully capitalize on its potential, it remains an enjoyable experience with its innovative gameplay mechanics. 7.5/10",

        "review": "Watch Dogs Review\r\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)\r\n\r\nOverview: Watch Dogs launched in 2014 as a highly anticipated title from Ubisoft, set in a near-future version of Chicago. Players step into the shoes of Aiden Pearce, a skilled hacker seeking vengeance after a family tragedy. While the game introduced an intriguing premise with its focus on hacking and surveillance, it garnered mixed reviews due to various gameplay and narrative elements.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nHacking Mechanics: The core feature of Watch Dogs is its hacking system, allowing players to manipulate various aspects of the environment, including traffic lights, cameras, and electronic devices. While the concept is innovative, the execution can feel limited. Hacking is often reduced to simple button prompts, which can detract from the sense of immersion.\r\n\r\nCombat and Stealth: Combat in Watch Dogs is serviceable but lacks depth. Players can engage in direct confrontations, utilize a range of weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The stealth mechanics are not as refined as in other titles, leading to some frustrating moments when trying to evade detection.\r\n\r\nOpen World Exploration: The open-world environment of Chicago is richly detailed and filled with activities, from side missions to collectibles. However, while the world is visually impressive, it can feel empty and repetitive over time. The driving mechanics are decent, though vehicles can sometimes feel unwieldy.\r\n\r\nStory and Characters\r\nNarrative: The story centers around themes of revenge, privacy, and the consequences of a digitally connected world. While the premise is compelling, the execution often falls flat. Aiden Pearce can come off as a one-dimensional character, and the supporting cast lacks depth, making it hard to fully invest in their journeys.\r\n\r\nCharacter Development: While Aiden's motivations are clear, his character development is limited. Supporting characters often feel like tropes rather than fully fleshed-out individuals, which weakens the overall narrative impact.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Performance\r\nVisuals: Watch Dogs showcases impressive graphics, particularly in its depiction of Chicago. The city is beautifully rendered, with detailed environments and realistic weather effects. However, some textures and animations can feel dated, particularly in comparison to more recent titles.\r\n\r\nPerformance: While the game runs reasonably well on most systems, players have reported occasional bugs and glitches that can disrupt the experience. Load times are generally acceptable, but some players may experience performance drops during intense action sequences.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack and Audio\r\nThe soundtrack features a mix of ambient music and radio stations that fit the game's urban setting. Voice acting is decent, but the dialogue can sometimes feel wooden or clich\u00e9d, detracting from the overall immersion.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWatch Dogs is a game with a fascinating concept and an engaging world, but it ultimately struggles with execution. While the hacking mechanics and open-world exploration provide moments of enjoyment, the narrative and character development leave much to be desired.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: If you're a fan of open-world games and enjoy themes of hacking and surveillance, Watch Dogs is worth a try. However, be prepared for some shortcomings in gameplay and storytelling. The game laid the groundwork for its sequels, which improved upon many of its flaws, making it an interesting entry point for the franchise but not without its faults.",

Maybe thats because i've looked into things about his character that might not even be intentional, so he might not be as likeable as i make him be. But maybe thats a sign for others to look at things beyond the surface and do some deep dive, because he really is amazing. \n\nBut the game is really good. The graphics are great but not extraordinary for the time it came out. I honestly dont know how to properly express the words in my brain. I've got over 100+ hours and i've played this game so much it messed with my brain for awhile. So draw your own conclusion from that i guess. Oh and buy bad blood too.\n\nMore: The multiplayer has been disabled, but it pretty much doesn't take anything away from the main game, its still enjoyable. The sidequests are repetitive but the ones where you have to search for audio logs really adds to the story. Plus, they're sidequests. You dont gotta do them if you find them boring.",

The gameplay was good, gunplay was surprisingly good, the driving was good as well and graphically the game looks nice and polished as well for the age of the game. The story was amazing and the characters and there development were great. The story felt heavy and the sidemissions felt like you were actually being a vigilante (even though some of them felt a little dry and repetitive). \r\n\r\nOverall great game. I definitely recommend this.",

I'm pretty sure I bought this as part of some package and I wouldn't recommend paying more than $10 even if you're really curious about the game.\n\nThe game looks dated because the environmental art direction is lacking. It was trying to be realistic (for the time) and now the attempt just looks bland. It still manages to feel horribly optimized even with a decent PC from around 10 years after launch.\n\nThe story is so uninteresting and the characters so unlikeable that even the story missions feel almost as worthless of your time as all the crap \"activities\" that litter the map.\n\nThe gameplay is atrocious - the gunplay has no impact to it at all even with the heavy weapons, driving feels stiff and the camera works against you, the puzzles are braindead. This is a game where the gameplay was just barely tweaked to make a deceptive trailer, but the actual experience has very little to offer that'll impress.\n\nEdit, after finishing main story and DLC: the Bad Blood DLC is worth the $10 bucks I mentioned as an acceptable price for the game if you can make it through the slog that is the main campaign, so consider getting it if you see the price with it fall that low. The main characters of the DLC actually have personality that can carry the short story for the few hours that it lasts, and the missions have enough variety to keep you interested throughout.",

Game mechanics - basically almost like any other open world modern world exploration type game (GTA, Saints Row), except with a few more interactable objects throughout the game. New twist on side missions which unfortunately get tedious if you want to unlock items or achievements (IN-GAME, NOT STEAM). It can be fascinating to watch npcs, especially the privacy intrusions. The story is interesting, gameplay overall relatively fun.\r\nMOUSE ACCELERATION - YOU CAN TURN IT OFF!!! Messed the game up for me for the first few hours, after that - smooth sailing.\r\nThe game is fun, if you can get in on a sale and like third person open world games - it's worth checking out.",
