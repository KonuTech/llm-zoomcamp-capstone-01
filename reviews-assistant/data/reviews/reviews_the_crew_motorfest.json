I have only 5 hours in, but i can easily see 30-40-50+ more. To my big surprise, the 60 FPS limit is not bugging me that much, i can live with it.\n\nOne thing they can improve is the cockpit view, i drove a lot of hours in first person in FH5, but it doesnt look nice here.\n\nOther than that game looks great, DO YOU UbiSoft, DO YOU. With FH5 being kinda soulless y'all might be up for taking the throne of this kind of games with the next installment. Just dont release it with another 60 FPS limit, coz im not gonna buy it :D",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been playing The Crew Motorfest and I\u2019m genuinely impressed! \nAfter playing so many Ubisoft titles, I didn't expect what it turned out to be. First off, the map is vast, diverse, and really fun to explore. Lots of interesting and fun races and modes. The graphics are lovely, the physics of the vehicles feels interesting, as it does for an arcade game, and there\u2019s a huge variety of cars and customization options to dive into. The audio design, including the soundtrack, complements the experience perfectly.\nI've played Need for Speed: Payback, Unbound, and both Forza Horizon 4 and 5, and I have to say, I enjoy this game more. Right now, it feels like it's worth every penny, especially with the Steam discount! The future also looks bright, thanks to the \"Playlists\" system, which brings a lot of variety to the races and seems like it will continue to expand the game with fresh content, and we have a major update coming soon with a new island.\nThat said, there is one drawback: optimization. My 2022 setup handles 2K resolution decently, but sometimes there are drops in frames from stable 58-60, to 50, and it is felt. More advanced settings could really help smooth things out. Ubisoft could certainly work on polishing that aspect, and add some advanced settings.\nOverall, I\u2019d give it a solid \ud835\udfd6/\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfce as an arcade racing game, and I think it could even challenge Forza in some ways. Well done, Ivory Tower/Ubisoft!\n(P.S. I've spent about 60 hours playing the game, and by this point my review looks like this).",

        "review": "TL;DR : Yes this game is very similar to Forza Horizon 5, to the point I'd say it's FH5 with much fewer microtransactions, ACTUAL steering animations and a much, much better map which is worth the exploration, all of which leading to a great game totally worth checking out!\n\nActual review : \nThis game is my first experience with The Crew as a franchise, so I went in with no prior expectations whatsoever, and it got me hooked from the get-go!\nThe Hawaii map is really gorgeous from the lush tropical beachside to the cities and highways and everything in-between! \nThe soundtracks are really cool and come in different variations to match the vibes of any race or free-roam cruise you are experiencing.\nThe graphics and animations are nice, nothing breathtaking but also nothing short of great, and I'm surprised to see how many small details are here and there from your avatar resting their arm while cruising in interior camera to the handling animations while riding a bike, and speaking of handling, vehicles are much smoother to handle & drive than I've expected, it's still no FH5, but it's serviceable and gets the job done.\nThe multiplayer experience has been smooth so far as well with no server issues and a quick matchmaking (Grand races are sooooo fun!!) and as for PVE, you have summit which is your weekly leaderboard playlist which is fun but nothing special, and then you have my favorite part which is the many playlists you have in the game. So far I've only finished Made In Japan, and it was a really rewarding blast, and upon finishing any playlist you get to unlock challenges for that specific playlist as well, which adds more replayability and offers more awards. \nYou also have a much better sense of progression in this game compared to many modern racing games as the game offers a rather mediocre car at the beginning, and you have to grind your way to getting more cars and other vehicles which are also required to open some playlists.\nAs of writing this review, there are +700 vehicles in the game and only two of them are locked behind an actual paywall , all the rest are available to obtain using the in-game currency.\nThey are also adding a FREE map expansion later this year, and an OFFLINE MODE, both of which are the icing on the cake as for why this game is totally worth it, at least when it goes on sale. \n\nAnd lastly, while I'm aware it's an Ubisoft game, and as we all know Ubisoft is a big NO for many gamers these days for many good reasons, looking at what Ivory Towers (the actual developers) have pulled off with this game makes me really hopeful for their future and I hope they get more love and attention with their future releases, and the current additions of offline mode to Crew 2 and Motorfest and the huge discounts they both got is a very big & important step in that direction.",

        "review": "(Yap fest incoming) (428 hours on Xbox) When I heard this game was coming out, the only reason I was hyped about it was because it was based on one of my favorite Hawaiian Islands, but I could tell they took one too many pages out of horizons book, on top of the $70 price tag and the removal of The Crew 1, I was pretty disinterested pretty quickly.\n\nA few weeks passed by and I was getting pretty tired of Forza Horizon 5, I started seeing videos about how lackluster the game really was and how flavorless the map is, not to mention the reused content and constant flow of stupid car passes that seem cheap, but add up over time. I love Arcade Racers and having to drop Forza Horizon like that wasn't easy, but around the same time I heard The Crew MotorFest was on sale, and from the videos I saw there weren't many negative things people were saying about it, so I picked it up. \n\nI mean this with all seriousness, I have not had this much fun with an arcade racer since Forza Horizon 3's peak. Literally my only concern about the game was if it was ever going to shut down one day just like the first game, because I want to pass my game accounts down to my children. But I'm happy to say, they have announced that The Crew 2 and MotorFest will be getting offline patches. They made stupid decisions back then and they learned. Looking forward to this game's future. \n\nI could go on and on about why I love this game so much compared to everything else on the market but that would take forever, besides The Crew game's go on sale all the time, so when they do, pick it up if you are looking for raw fun, because I've purchased this game four times, on all different kinds of platforms, and I don't regret it one bit. Well.. besides the Xbox one version, that was practically unplayable. \n\nAnd I'm not going to pretend it doesn't have it's problems, but from what I've observed from the past year they are all ears to the community, and they have clearly taken action in many aspects. (If a dev reads this please fix the players disappearing in the open world, add more PVP options, and unlock the fps.. please lol)\n\nAlso if you're wondering how I got my Xbox account to Steam, I literally just added Ubisoft Connect to my Xbox and then logged in with the same account on PC. Good job Ubisoft, Never thought I'd say that. Or if I ever will again.\n\n(Update 9/12/24) It seems both games are being review bombed over old information, what I'll say is millions that may not be in a financial position to be spending 60 / 70 dollars on video games now have the opportunity to do so, which is great. The Crew 1 is gone, I'm not happy about it ether, but we should be rewarding good behavior. And to whoever is saying \"They won't stick to there word about offline\" I don't know if you noticed but the E.U. will be at Ubisoft's door soon, so stop conspiring and just have fun.",

        "review": "If you are looking to play this and think it is another Forza Horizon, then you are not too far off. The game itself is one of the more better racing games on the market today. Ubisoft did a excellent job of creating a beautiful environment to drive and discover, with much detail and care in gameplay and while still maintaining the arcade physics of the handling of the vehicles. The game has beautiful and stunning visuals and eye candy, with the scenery and also with many vehicles to race and collect. Overall this game has a good fun factor and any true racing fan should have this game in their library. Unlike in the Forza Horizon series there are also countless planes, boats, bikes to collect and race as well, giving a huge variety of races to participate in. The combined beautiful landscape and the different themes of style of races on the island itself, makes this really that much more enjoyable and worth the time to play through and take in. The storyline which is also a simple and straight forward goal to just become the best ultimate racer in this motorsport competition. Many options are also presented to the player, as they can customize gameplay accordingly to their preferences and skill. The background soundtracks used in this game are good, many that will get you more in the mood as you play this often and over time you then begin to enjoy hearing them more, as they often blend well with the game's atmosphere and race theme setting. The music consists of rock, techno, drum and bass, new wave, classics from the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's style music. So, with the above mentioned it is very much a polished racing game at it's peak right now. There are some flaws here and there, but nothing that can be seriously noticed right away to any casual players who just want to experience something all over again with the feeling of arcade style racing.\n\nNow the things that may need some addressing, first off is the online races. I feel that in most cases with any online racing that everyone has different skill and of course that means, there are players who are advanced and some just looking to have fun. What i found out is the online races in this are somewhat of a limitation to what kinds of vehicles the player uses in order to have a huge advantage over those with less skill. Example is: That if a player goes with the choice of having anything that is considered vintage or vehicles that are just slow in general, then prepare to get beaten every time. The races are mixed and with no expectations of being pared up with someone who has the same class or tier of car to go against. In general the online races feel not very balanced and more less forced to have something \"as good\" as the other player has, (only modern era vehicles will do anything in these races). I'm very happy to hear they will soon offer an offline mode coming soon for this game, purely for the reasons above about online races.\n\nWhat else is there?\n\nAnother flaw that I think most of us have noticed is that when doing a playlist for the first time, we are loaned specific vehicles to take part in those races. This kind of defeats the purpose of upgrading and collecting vehicles that you want to use in scenario's of entering each single catagory of tier in that playlist. I kind of understand that at the same time the playlists would become much more easy and less fun, if everyone was going to use a upgraded hypercar to beat them. At least it is nice that they also included the option to customize these events after you beat the playlist challenges. Customizing the playlists do add a desire to just use the vehicle you want and how you want it, while it also gives the player a chance to practice driving specific vehicles in races VS bots of any level of difficulty of settings and preference for the custom event.\n\nWith all the above said, I do recommend buying this game when it is on sale or at regular price. It is a very polished and beautiful racing game to have and play for all levels of players. Support Ubisoft and so they will make more games like this in the future.",

        "review": "I recently bought The Crew 2 as it was on sale for $1, and I had played it on console a while ago. It is still an amazing game. Then I see Motorfest is on sale as well, and you can transfer cars, which I thought was a nice addition. So after playing The Crew 2 for a few days I bought Motorfest.\n\n My initial reactions were not good. The intro was ok, but then you are forced to choose a playlist, which I didn't want to do, as I hadn't even been in the actual game yet, and I wasn't sure what I was even picking. I then choose a playlist and enter the game. Immediately disliked the amount and SIZE of all of the popups that flood your screen. I still haven't found out if there is a way to reduce the size of virtually everything.\n\nThen, of course, there is the playlists. Where The Crew 2 had, in my opinion, a fabulous system for organized and separate racing disciplines, The Crew Motorfest has NOTHING of the sort. EVERY SINGLE PLAYLIST is 100% loaned cars. The cars you own are only for replaying races already completed and PVP races.\n\nWant a playlist strictly for touring cars? Too bad! Want a playlist where you just get to race without NPC's giving you a storyline about the plot and background? Too bad! Motorfest has stripped virtually all of the progression that made the previous Crew games fun, and FORCE you to use other people's cars.\n\nThe map... good lord... the map. Hawaii should have been a DLC for The Crew 2. I want cross-country interstates, long snaking back-roads, mountain passes, and coastal roads that go on for what feels like an eternity. I feel like the enormous maps are kind of a staple for Crew games, no? The map is WAY too small compared to previous Crew games.\n\nNow the positive part. The graphics are very good. The sound design and quality... SUBLIME. Map quality and feel (regardless of size) is also very nice. I'm sort of torn on the handling, while I understand others' praise for the more simcade feel, which I like, I also loved the more arcade feel of handling in The Crew 2, just my preference.\n\nThis is a GOOD GAME, I just can't say I think it is a good Crew game. It feels nothing like the previous Crew games. I understand games are supposed to change and evolve, but I feel this changed in many ways I wasn't hoping it to.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to fans of previous Crew games who loved them for the same reasons I did.\n\nLastly, please let us set TCS, ESC, and ABS PER VEHICLE!\n\nThank you.",

TCMF is also far more varied in environment, plus the colors pop out a lot more.\n\n+ Offline mode is being worked on (around November). TDUSC is planned, but nothing concrete as of yet.\n\n+ More Racing Modes / Styles. TDUSC focuses on road and off-road racing, but they feel too janky.\n\n+ Bikes and other vehicle types. I wish more racing games allowed you to use not only boats and planes, but also bikes. MCLA was the last game I've played that had Bikes on a racing game that wasn't solely focused on it.\n\n4 Shakas out of 5.",

My second biggest gripe is the map, its not bad and it is very detailed and a nice place to drive around and explore but what made the crew stand out in the first place was the HUGE map in the first and second game it made it feel special like no other arcade racer offered a playable area of that scale.\nThe Graphics are great and the details like steering wheel and shifter movements are great, the driving physics are vastly improved as well, if they made another game with the scale of Crew 1&2 with the polish and feel of Motorfest it would be an epic game.\nIf you can get Motorfest on sale its a decent buy otherwise imo The Crew 2 offers way more to do and better value",

The conversations the protagonists in that game had were dumb, but they were relatable in a way. \n\nThis game tries to do that and by God it does such a fucking horrible job at it. It's a DRIVING game. And a good one! Genuinely without the horribly written dialogue it would be so much better. \n\nAnyway, aside from that, it's a good game! The driving feels fucking amazing, the environment is great, the animations are great in first person, they feel somewhat natural unlike most games where you move the wheel like, 10\u00b0. I can't speak for whether this game is culturally insensitive or not so I'm just not gonna go into thst topic. \n\nGenuinely this is a fun game, I've had a blast with it so far, but some things do drag it back. \n\nOh, and support the people working on TCU. Ubisoft did a scummy move there, they've promised not to do it again but believing that is like believing Simon Harris when he says he cares about kids with scoliosis.",

        "review": "Top pros for me:\n+steering, best arcade steering I experienced. Yes, i played forza and this one seems more immersing for me. Forza one is too \"gummy\" or \"plasticine\" for me. This just seems more \"mechanical\" and I like it a lot. So, if someone shares same feeling about FH5, this is it. Sense of weight is quite simmilar, so very good in both cases.\n+++lighting - breathtaking by occasion\n+map (roads, nature, views, but no real city)\n+activities\n+lot of vehicles, moslty cars\n+collectibles like murals - beautiful.\n\nTop cons:\n-game forces you to some things, like buying exact cars, completing A LOT of activities to e.g. unlock fast travel. 10 full playlists is definately too much for that reward. I get devs want us to visit whole island, but forcing is never proper way. Maybe they dont trust the players enough.\n-another festival\n-too easy progression, getting too much cars\n-no big city\n-no selling cars option\n-necessity to buy certain cars, which you get anyway later, so you end up with multiple cars you dont really want\n-steering of motorbikes\n-really weird physics of boats sometimes\n-drifting competitions - the fact that even soft touching of objects canceles the combo is just frustrating. In real world drifting you get extra points for \"kissing the wall\", here you are punished - not cool. Generaly I consider drifitng physics good, also depends on the car, but counting score is annoying at some moments.\n-difficulty levels are very uneven. 4 is sometimes very easy, sometimes, quite challenging and gap to 5 is huge, too huge. 5 is sometimes easy and sometimes undoable, impossible to compete. Give opponents same cars as players get, not scripted ones. Make it fair.\n-*the fact that you have to do same races, when in the crew, and that you dont progress if being on same stage, *although im not quite sure, if i check it properly\n\nIs ok, but could be better:\n\\sense of speed\n\\sounds of cars\nThese two come from TDU Solar Crown, which shows how it can be done. I get it TCM has a lot more cars, and some of the sounds are really cool, but why not try aiming for better ones. Sense of speed from cockpit is cool, but from behind the car, again, TDU SC is better, therefore - pinned for moodboard. In case of sounds I'm being quite picky, it would just make perfect game, it's much better then TC2 for sure big improvement.\n\\UI - with that number of cars available its should be solved differently. Grid would help for example. Moving around single row looking for one brand at dealership or findind that one car among your cars might be too time-consuming for that simple task.\n\\not sure about relation between time reversing and time measurement and the fact it doesnt reverse as well. i get why it might be like that, but im not certain its best. And Im not a fan of reversing time mechanincs being available generally.\n\nGenerally I adore this game. Natural views are amazing. Unfortunately lacking really urban ones. Car game that is giving me absolute joy, which I didnt get for a while and didn't expect from this title. The cons I listed would give me the perfect car game I seek for a long time, but this one is suprisingly close. If I wouldnt be showered with money and cars, and get actual feel of progression and big city that would be perfect.\n\nI don's usually write reviews, but i see potential in this game I didnt's see for a long time in this ganre, which i care about, and wanted to share some observations, feedback and feelings. Looking forward to more street vibe in this series in the future, if ubisoft survives.\n\nKeep up the good work devs.",

And no, it doesn't depend on my PC specs, it can run FH5 on ultra just fine, and it happens on every settings combination possible.\r\nUbisoft made a great game, but made it unplayable.",

This is, by far, the most enjoyable open-world racer I\u2019ve ever played. It just takes a little time to get into. But once you do, it\u2019s an absolute joy to play.\n\nOver the past week, I\u2019ve spent about 20 to 25 hours playing on both my Xbox Series X and PC (apparently running the game as an admin causes the \u2018hours played\u2019 to not display correctly). And so far, this has been an absolute blast.\n\nThe game modes are a great with a ton of variety (the playlist system is fantastic). The map looks absolutely stunning with a nice mix of urban, off-road, and jungle. The settings and tuning options make driving the cars a true pleasure. Plus, it has cross-save, so I can switch between my XSX and PC seamlessly. It's very much an arcade racer, not a sim, but if that\u2019s your style, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nThe only downside for me is the performance. The game does have some micro-stutters and freezes, and it took a bit of tweaking to (mostly) even things out (turn off the Ubi overlay on PC\u2014trust me). But once I got everything dialed in, it\u2019s been smooth sailing. For reference, I\u2019m running it on a 6650XT and a Ryzen 7 7700X.\n\nSummary: This is one of the best\u2014if not [i]the[/i] best\u2014open-world arcade racing games out there. It\u2019s not flawless, but it\u2019s damn close and on sale, it is truly a steal.\n\nEdit: Turn off CARA, voice, and subtitles. You can thank me later.",

        "review": "Be forewarned: Racing through the \"story mode\" is not done with your own cars. Yet you are required to purchase some vehicles to progress, vehicles you will not use. \r\n\r\nEven with a heavy discount, The Crew: Motorfest is immensely disappointing. Racing with your own vehicles is seemingly discouraged as you are required to progress through \"playlists\" before being able to return in your own vehicles to race. The VOs during the racing are irritating to the point of myself muting them. Despite the inclusion of rally cars, there is only ONE dedicated rally race. Plenty of rally raids (cross country for those who played Forza), but they feel about as fun as they do in Forza (as in not very fun at all). And despite the inclusion of aircraft like racing planes and stunt planes, in Ubisoft fashion they are both slow and awful to fly. You cant even pull a loop or aeileron roll. Ubisoft remembered yaw exists, but made stunt planes unable to do stunts while flying at helicopter speeds. I really cant get over the fact the top speed of the aircraft is approaching their real-life counterpart's landing speed.\r\n\r\nFor the amount of obvious effort put in, it seems the developers forgot to make the game fun. The developers seemed to prioritize celebrity (or perhaps 'influencer' is a better word) cameos and digitalized history over refining what makes a racing game fun. I don't care all that much about 'Supercar Blondie' or 'Hoonigan' all that much, and while I like Donut Media, there are other members besides James Pumphrey. As for the parts of the game about car culture, they would be a lot more fun if they weren't shoved down our throats. I like learning about car culture and car history. Heck, I have a degree in history, but the information is so shallow and the delivery so irritating I'd get a superior experience by listening to a podcast while playing subway surfers.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Its more like a really bad Crew 2 DLC than a full fledged sequel. I heavily regret giving it a chance past the refund period.",

But they decided to scrap that whole identity for this game to just focus on relatively small island. This game feels like it is a DLC for The Crew 2 not a standalone game. The map looks good and detailed yes, but what made past entries fun was to cruise on this huge map for hours.\nAlso, this game feels so bland, the non-existent story doesn't help either. The first 3 to 4 hours you just race loaned cars on already made playlists that are only set apart by the cars you drive in them.\nTo be honest if you want a good open world racing game you should buy The Crew 2 [spoiler](well since The Crew 1 is just gone)[/spoiler].",

TCM has 3x bigger map than FH4 and it is fun and detailed, FH4 map was boring and 70% of the map were vegetation field and jungle\n2. The story / playlist in TCM are way more interesting and diverse than FH4 \n3. You can fly an airplane ,drive a boat and ride motorbike in TCM\n4. Crew series more focus on playful and creative experience while FH series more on serious and professional experience\n5. A lot of customization in TCM\n6. Every playlist / story in TCM is unique, creative, plus with real life production cutscenes, in the other hand, most of the story/playlist in FH4 basically just driving from A to B\n7. every race path in TCM is more challenging and every path felt different compare to FH4\n8. Nitro and LED\n9. Characters in TCM feels more alive while FH4 feels more robotic\n10. More realistic weather\n11. Lighting, reflection were so good compare to FH4\n12. Environment physics was better in TCM\n\nCons\n1. Crew series graphic/visual style more cartoon-ish, FH series more realistic\n2. No NPC and animal in TCM\n3. Less car in TCM\n4. No offline mode and server can be unstable sometime\n5. TCM In game menu not so user friendly\n6. Most car physics and driving mechanism in TCM were less realistic than FH\n7. Controlling was better and realistic in FH\n8. Car mirror in TCM just a decoration\n9. You cannot own any houses in TCM\n\n\nOverall I really enjoy playing this game !",

I finished atm the \"Porscheplaylist\" and the \"Japanplaylist\". This is the best raceingamestorymode i played the last years. This game took a lot of the good stuff from \"Forza Horizon\" and \"Need for Speed\" and made it better. I payed below 20\u20ac on sale on Steam, and this seems totally fair atm. I like Forza Horizon and NFS too, but this game is better than NFS Unbound because of the storymode. PC3, PC2 and Automoblista 2 are also good racinggames but they dont have such a good storymode. \r\n\r\nrx6600xt 8gb, 5800x, 32gb 3200MHz (the game needs like 15gb on high) amd driversetting rsr 1440 -> 4k 50\" 1200Hz Panasonic TV HDR10 -> around 48 Fps on high -> looks really good and smooth\r\n\r\nxbox one controller works perfect\r\n\r\nthx to the devteam for this great work.",

BUT I was genuinely surprised how fun this game is.\r\n\r\nThe presentation and driving is 100% much better than FH5, albeit the lack of a ''search'' setting on liveries kinda suck but the map is actually fun and interesting compared to the boring fields n empty wastes of FH5 \r\n\r\nThe cars also are actually good, FH5 would just hype you like crazy cause they were adding some granny's old Toyota Tercel or DLC packs with already-ingame cars just with cool parts like cmon man I want some cars for RACING! Here they separate em by classes instead of tuning so you won't be seeing some old fiat going at lightspeeds next to crazy lambos and bugattis \r\n\r\nThe biggest complaint however is the beyond-glitchy Ubisoft overlay, yes I know me too at first I was like ''oh great more bloatware'' but at least they do something interesting with the system by doing challenges that grants you points to buy some ingame exclusive goodies which is actually impressive from some third-party installation . However it just freezes up on screen when it opens up, meaning you gotta close the game and open it up again whenever that happens. \r\n\r\nBut yeah honestly if you want a fun arcade racer that doesnt dabble too much into realism and just want high speed, stunts and crazy cars give this one a go (especially if its on mega-sale like right now)\r\n\r\nOh and your main character is Gordon-Freeman'esque silent, and does not cringe-babble like in FH5. Thats a big win TBH",

This game has that same amount of fun packed into a vibrant and beautiful island. \n\nThis game and series in general still has work that needs to be done on it but it is by far much more fun than the current state of Forza, this is due to the fact that it incorporates multiple features that the developers know the community wants and the devs actually listened to the community and continue to improve the game. \n\nThe progression system is great and you can tell this game was made with love and having fun in mind. Great experience, no complaints, very well done making a arcade game in between the likes of Need for speed, Forza & Midnight Club Racing.

And the fact that it loads fast and has bikes, boats and planes is also cool.\n\nForza horizon is like the main chick and crew motor-fest is like the disabled side chick that is fun in very specific ways.",

The vehicle selection is vast, and each car handles uniquely, making driving feel engaging and fun no matter what you're racing.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are top-notch, with detailed car models and beautifully designed environments that enhance the immersion. Whether you're speeding through urban streets or tearing up off-road trails, the graphics add to the thrill of the race.\r\n\r\nOne of the game's highlights is its variety of events. There\u2019s always something new to do, with a broad selection of races and challenges that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The diversity of events ensures you\u2019re never stuck doing the same thing twice, making every session feel different and engaging.\r\n\r\nAlthough an offline mode is expected to be patched in at a later date, it\u2019s currently an online-only experience. Once implemented, it will likely broaden the game's appeal, allowing players to enjoy it without needing a constant connection.\r\n\r\nIn short, The Crew Motorfest brings a compelling mix of fast-paced racing, stunning visuals, and varied gameplay, making it a strong contender for any racing fan\u2019s collection\u2014even more so when the offline mode arrives.",

        "review": "The Crew Motorfest stands out as a serious competitor to Forza Horizon 5, and for good reason. It offers an incredible open-world experience with a massive map filled with endless exploration opportunities, thrilling races, engaging side-quests, and a wealth of challenges. The game's car handling feels superb, even for each car-type, delivering a realistic and satisfying driving experience that truly sets it apart.\n\nOne of the game's highlights is the wide variety of race playlists you can dive into, each offering unique themes and even car rewards, making the progression system highly rewarding and exciting. The stunning graphics bring the game's world to life, enhancing the overall immersion and making every race feel like a high-octane spectacle.\n\nHowever, the game's difficulty system leaves room for improvement. The lower levels (1-2) are simply too easy, while level 3 is still on the easy side for seasoned racing gamers. Level 4 demands a good amount of skill just to place in the top 3, and level 5 feels nearly impossible. The AI's flawless driving and highly effective nitro usage make it extremely tough to catch up, and the marginal +4% reward isn't enough incentive, especially when the challenge feels unfair.\n\nDespite this, The Crew Motorfest delivers an exhilarating racing experience packed with content and challenges that keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of open-world racers, this game is definitely worth a spin!",

It requires you to follow a specific format and buy vehicles that you don't want to. The difficulty level is so random.

Also side not the cars in my opinion sound so much better than fh5 by far. I do not regret buying personally, Any lag or crashes ive seen other people experiance i have gotten non of so idk whats that about either, game runs amazing for me with stunning graphics and beautiful areas to explore or just shoot past as fast as humanly possible.",

        "review": "First impressions:\r\n\r\nAll I've heard about this game is what it's not. It isn't as big of an open world as the previous games. It isn't Forza Horizon, but it really wants to be. So on and so forth.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed previous two games in this series a lot, and I agree, it's definitely moving away from an identity of its own to be more of a rival to Forza Horizon (which I also enjoy a lot). This started with the previous game, but it's more apparent here. In some ways it's shameless; this game is trying to not only evoke that Forza Horizon festival feeling and its smorgasbord of activities to pursue. But it's also trying to capitalise on other elements of the open world racing genre that Forza Horizon fans have been crying out for. The game is set in a genre-favourite location famous from Test Drive Unlimited, and the very first playlist of events offered to you is all about Japanese car culture where they do a surprisingly good job of immersing you in a neon cityscape despite the game's setting being very much otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess that's the thing. I've seen this game labelled as Aldi brand Forza Horizon, and it has perhaps earned that snark in chasing that game's success too obviously. But if it delivers fan-requested features and does it well... shouldn't that be celebrated? I can't speak to the endgame / live service aspect to this title yet, but if it's anything like The Crew 2, I'll be playing it just as much as I played Forza Horizon. Horizon remains the better game, probably, but this one is well worth playing too. They've much improved on the car handling from previous games, the open world feels more detailed for being smaller, and I'm a big fan of their events playlist system. I didn't even find the voiced characters all that cringeworthy... though the AI assistant could be toned down a bit.\r\n\r\nGrabbed this on sale and I'm plenty happy with it.",
