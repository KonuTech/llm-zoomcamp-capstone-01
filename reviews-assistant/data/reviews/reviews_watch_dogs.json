When we compare it to other watch dogs, watch dogs 1 and bad blood hold the best story writing. The game does show its age with time but still enjoyable even in 2024. gameplay is really nice but shooting and driving are not the best. After an hour or so u will get used to it though. Best playable on 60 fps, if u play on 120 fps u will run into some issues during elevator animation and few places here and there. But still my favourite watch dogs in the series.",

The only thing i would complain about, is the lack of attention to the driving physics - i would compare it to driving a car in a ice rink and their response to collisions, well they're dog shit - crowbcat did an excellent job to show how terrible the collisions in this game in general. <you can check out his video out in yt ;)>\n\n8.9/10\n\n\n",

        "review": "Watch_Dogs, developed by Ubisoft, is an open-world action-adventure game that introduces players to the world of cyber warfare and surveillance. Set in a near-future version of Chicago, players control Aiden Pearce, a skilled hacker who uses his abilities to manipulate the city\u2019s infrastructure via a central operating system (ctOS) while seeking revenge for a personal tragedy. The game is a unique blend of hacking, stealth, and traditional open-world combat, providing a fresh twist on the genre.\n\nThe standout feature of Watch_Dogs is its hacking mechanics, which allow players to control traffic lights, cameras, and even power grids to outsmart enemies and solve missions. The game also offers fluid driving mechanics, dynamic combat, and a diverse array of side activities, from criminal investigations to mini-games like poker. However, despite its innovative ideas, the game sometimes feels weighed down by its somewhat generic protagonist and a narrative that lacks the emotional depth it aims for. In addition, the world can feel underutilized, as many of the side missions fall into repetitive patterns.\n\nPros:\n\n-Innovative hacking mechanics that add depth to gameplay.\n-Expansive and detailed open-world Chicago.\n-Diverse set of side activities and mini-games.\n\nCons:\n\n-Main story and protagonist feel underdeveloped.\n-Repetitive side missions and objectives.\n-Hacking mechanics can become overly simplified over time.\n\nOverall, Watch_Dogs presents a fresh and creative take on the open-world genre, especially for players who enjoy technological themes and hacking. While it doesn\u2019t fully capitalize on its potential, it remains an enjoyable experience with its innovative gameplay mechanics. 7.5/10",

Maybe thats because i've looked into things about his character that might not even be intentional, so he might not be as likeable as i make him be. But maybe thats a sign for others to look at things beyond the surface and do some deep dive, because he really is amazing. \n\nBut the game is really good. The graphics are great but not extraordinary for the time it came out. I honestly dont know how to properly express the words in my brain. I've got over 100+ hours and i've played this game so much it messed with my brain for awhile. So draw your own conclusion from that i guess. Oh and buy bad blood too.\n\nMore: The multiplayer has been disabled, but it pretty much doesn't take anything away from the main game, its still enjoyable. The sidequests are repetitive but the ones where you have to search for audio logs really adds to the story. Plus, they're sidequests. You dont gotta do them if you find them boring.",

I'm pretty sure I bought this as part of some package and I wouldn't recommend paying more than $10 even if you're really curious about the game.\n\nThe game looks dated because the environmental art direction is lacking. It was trying to be realistic (for the time) and now the attempt just looks bland. It still manages to feel horribly optimized even with a decent PC from around 10 years after launch.\n\nThe story is so uninteresting and the characters so unlikeable that even the story missions feel almost as worthless of your time as all the crap \"activities\" that litter the map.\n\nThe gameplay is atrocious - the gunplay has no impact to it at all even with the heavy weapons, driving feels stiff and the camera works against you, the puzzles are braindead. This is a game where the gameplay was just barely tweaked to make a deceptive trailer, but the actual experience has very little to offer that'll impress.\n\nEdit, after finishing main story and DLC: the Bad Blood DLC is worth the $10 bucks I mentioned as an acceptable price for the game if you can make it through the slog that is the main campaign, so consider getting it if you see the price with it fall that low. The main characters of the DLC actually have personality that can carry the short story for the few hours that it lasts, and the missions have enough variety to keep you interested throughout.",

        "review": "Bought it on sale as the trilogy bundle. Figured out - why the heck not, lets try it out. Game mechanics - basically almost like any other open world modern world exploration type game (GTA, Saints Row), except with a few more interactable objects throughout the game. New twist on side missions which unfortunately get tedious if you want to unlock items or achievements (IN-GAME, NOT STEAM). It can be fascinating to watch npcs, especially the privacy intrusions. The story is interesting, gameplay overall relatively fun.\r\nMOUSE ACCELERATION - YOU CAN TURN IT OFF!!! Messed the game up for me for the first few hours, after that - smooth sailing.\r\nThe game is fun, if you can get in on a sale and like third person open world games - it's worth checking out.",

Even though my review for base game is 8.4 complete version is 8.7 and modded revamped lives up to 9 out of 10 I still think its a masterpiece.",
