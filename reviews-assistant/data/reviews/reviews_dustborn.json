        "review": "So, in my original review, I'd played 3 hours of this game, was absolutely kicked in the head by how awful this was, and gave it a 2/10. I've now completed the game for the first time, and gotten the \"Librarian\" ending, where you end up going to Nova Scotia to assist the people there. I'll break down the review so people can get a proper understanding of it.\n\nStory: 2/10\nThis has got to be the most dismally explained, poorly written b.s. I've had to sit through in a long time. And the game is practically 14 fucking hours of it. The environment and background is poorly explained, you know nothing as to how America ended up being this near-apocalyptic wasteland, you have no idea how the Echoes came to be except \"something something Broadcast\", you have no explanation as to how your \"words\" manifest into reality in such an enhanced way compared to how we communicate. It's \"magic\". Because the game told you it was. For no reason. \n\nAnyway, the story itself revolves around you being an Anomal, someone that has \"magic abilities\" that people despise for \"some reason\" and you have to carry a \"package\" across all of America into Nova Scotia. So far, cool, sounds good. Except the story itself should have ended in the first 10 minutes where the cop pulls a gun on you and should have simply shot. You escape and begin a mad dash across America, picking up other Anomals along the way with their own abilities, dodging 2 law enforcement agencies (Justice and Puritans) to get the information into Canada, whilst masquerading as a rock band. Solid idea, if the writing itself wasn't so cringe and deplorable that I ended up making a game where I'd take a shot of rum for every time I actively cringed at the writing, only to have to stop at Episode 3 because I was afraid I'd get alcohol poisoning. The ending itself is so terribly rushed, makes literally fuckall sense that I simply cannot believe the testers actually got this far.\n\nEnvironment: 7/10\nPretty decent, if lacking in background. I did like the Jet Set Radio cross - comic book vibes, but there were some lighting issues I couldn't overlook and some shadowing that was goofy.\n\nCombat: 0/10\nSeriously. The fuck. I played on the hardest difficulty. I died ONCE. AND I RESPAWNED TO THE SAME BOSS ON THE SAME HP HE WAS WHEN I DIED. THERE WAS NO CONSEQUENCES TO MY DEATHS AT ALL. The combat is janky, you can effectively ignore literally all the special combat stuff and left-click to victory aside from needing to taunt to break a shield or two. Whoever the fuck thought this combat was good needs to play actual combat games. Disgraceful. And hearing the main character scream \"bitch attack\" all the time made me turn off sound in game. so grinding.\n\nMusic:\nI'm splitting this into two. Environmental music: 7/10. Pretty decent, the combat music was nice, and the campfire guitar music was good.\nThe \"play-along-rock-music\": 0/10. Straight up. The worst, most on-the-nose, terrible music I've heard in a video game. \"We're the new porn\" is so cringe I ended up completely turning off the sound during the final few rock sequences. I shouldn't have to do that, ever. Terrible. Drowning a cat would be better.\n\nTLDR: 2/10, 3/10 if I'm really pushing it. I got so tired of the bad writing, bad music and bad explanations with terrible characters (except Sol, he was cool) that I ended up having something else on a different screen so I could tune out and come back to the game when I had a reason to interact. If you're here for LGBTQ+ stuff, great! You still won't like it. If you're here for political stuff, great! You definitely will not enjoy it. It is not a psychological horror, either. Do not make this into a drinking game either, it'll kill you. \n\nTo the devs and studio: I'm sorry you got hate speech and whatnot to your studio directly, that sucks, but for the love of all that is holy, never cook again.",

        "review": "Despite the negative reviews, I went into Dustborn with a fair and open mind. This is a Norwegian developed game, which is partly funded by Viken, which is where I grew up! So I had to give it a fair shake.\nI enjoy walking sims, and I enjoy a lot of games that do their best to focus on diversity; are all the negative reviews just \"anti woke haters\"?\n\nSadly the game comes across as a parody of itself, and it's hard to take anything seriously.\n\nI think there are overall two main issues with the story. Firstly, it suffers from having a \"fighting game story\", where there are too many characters with too many backstories to give proper attention to all of it, so random parts are just shoehorned together.\nFor example, a character might say early on that they are self conscious and anxious. Instead of this being a part of their identity, and they show these signs throughout the story, they will just randomly have a scene where they are acting extremely out of character to show this trait which was mentioned prior.\nThere's a scene (very mild spoilers) where you need to open a locked door. One of your main crew members have a power to do exactly that. Keep in mind, you have been chased across multiple state borders, the cops could be here at any moment, so you need to hurry and get inside. This crew member tells you \"No, I think I will skip this one, I am feeling self conscious and don't just wanna be seen as a door opener, I am not feeling it right now\", and you tell them that it is okay, you respect their boundaries and don't wanna make them uncomfortable. This comes across as very off character, because this is not how they have acted previously, and now that we need them the most it's all of the sudden a big problem?\n\nThe writers want to add good messages to each character and their conditions, but sadly the writers are not good at making it a part of the story, so they very explicitly and on the nose force situations like these, that ultimately fails to deliver the message and just makes the character look like an idiot.\nDo I believe that when you're having a bad mental health day you should be given space, time and respect? Yes, 100%, but no one would act like this in a life or death situation.\n\nThis also goes the other way, where the character mentions something about themselves that is critical to keep in mind, such as a character turning into a helpless statue if they get too anxious, but this is never brought up again.\n\nThe second issue the game really suffers from is the idiot plot. This means that the story only moves forward due to idiot decisions, and this is very much true here.\nThe whole plot is about a stealth mission, let us make our cover story that we are a band so we constantly have to show up to public places and make noise. Also, all our songs are about the mission we're on. Glad no one caught on to that.\nOh, let us give the one thing we are supposed to protect to our team captain that loses it twice within the first couple of hours of the game.\nLet us, on our undercover mission, drive a one-of-a-kind bus with bright colors and branding on it.\nWe're in a bar full of cops when we know some of them are looking for us? Yeah let's stick around a little longer, surely nothing will go wrong, despite us talking about how we keep getting lucky after making dumb decisions.\n\nCharacter often act in ways that don't align with their core beliefs, nor in their best interest, and it's a frustrating experience to see someone endanger not only themselves but the rest of the crew just because \"ugh, I wanted to make this person jealous\". Either that, or they have extreme mood swings. They hate your guts, don't want to see you, don't want to travel with the crew, you are dead to them, then one minor event happens and they go \"You saved myu life, I love you, you're my sister again\"\n\nThe worst part is that most of the core crew are just... unlikable? The main character Pax is an asshole who bullies and berates anyone she meets, including her friends. Your crew members either don't wanna be there or constantly talk. They talk about absolutely nothing, like a 20 second rant about how their parents used to make a dish. Pax, the main character, is selfish, lies to the crew, and puts them in danger multiple times just to fulfill her own curiosity.\nThe other members talk holes into my head about drawing or random memories, thoughts or dreams they have. None of which build their character, or give interesting insight to the world.\n\nThe dialogue in itself is also very poorly written, and that includes choices you can make. Often dialogue is repeated, which makes for very awkward sounding conversations.\n\"I'm heading off to bed, it's late\"\n\"We got a long day ahead tomorrow, and it's late, so I'm going to sleep\"\nThis type of writing where the character repeats what they just said is common, and it ruins the immersion. Another issue with the writing is that the game often wants to take the story in a certain direction, but they also want to engage the player. This means that often you will get the \"choice\" between two almost identical prompts, or even worse, you will get a \"choice\" to select one singular prompt, which you might disagree with. This makes for a very frustrating experience when you would do something completely different, or nothing at all in a situation, but you are forced to be an asshole.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, combat is infuriatingly easy, you are practically invincible, and while you have both a dodge and a block, you don't need any of them in any encounter. I read online that you can't die, so I tried to lose on purpose in one of the encounters, and yep, you just stand back up again like nothing happened and continue fighting. The enemies don't even regain health.\nYou can beat any encounter using the throw bat mechanic as enemies are infinitely stunned, but honestly you could also just mash X.\n\nAs for the rhythm game, it's bad. There's a reason no other game has a layout like this. It is difficult to see notes flying and in what order, especially when they they are snuck in next to lyrics which is also flying the same direction. Luckily the rhythm game is also very easy, so I guess it doesn't matter too much.\n\nThat leaves exploration, which works as expected, there really is not much to say. Walk around and interact with the thing you need to move on. Sometimes this is painfully obvious, sometimes it's annoyingly well hidden. Not much to say about this.\n\nAnd the final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is riddled with technical issues like random framedrops and bugs. Characters will frequently teleport, run into walls (and keep running in place), the camera can get stuck so you're unable to proceed, you can lose the ability to run during combat, and sometimes prompts just doesn't show up, forcing you to restart the game.\n\nUltimately this is a game that tries to be about diversity, friendship through hardship, and \"doing the right thing\", and I have to ask if giving the mean main character abilities like \"CANCEL\" that convinces the enemy to kill themselves really aligns with these ideas. It feels hypocritical, the game is a parody of itself.",

        "review": "\tI bought this game on a dare from a friend. My plan was to finish it in a few days to see how bad it really was. I just completed chapter 4. To my shame, I found I lacked the pain tolerance and moral courage required to finish this abomination. This game is bad, but not funny cringe bad. Its just boring and repetitive bad. You have long conversations with an NPC delivered with all the grace and enthusiasm of 90's adult film dialogue. You have 8 similar conversations. You click to throw your bat at an enemy. You bust two ghosts. 12 more conversations ensue. The level ends. \n\n\tTime dilates when I play Dustborn. Every hour in real time feels like five hours in play time. I painfully digest every awkward, inane, syllable the way trauma victims experience witnessing spider cracks slowly creeping across a windshield during impact, hearing the metallic crunching of linked ammunition being fed into an emplaced PKM 200 yards away, or detecting the subtle hints of vanilla in a youth minster's aftershave. The only time I experienced an emotion anywhere close to fun was during the ghost busting. I used a mouse and it made it just difficult enough to generate a low level dopamine hit.\n\n\tMy best description of the games story is it feels like it was written by an extremely talented 12-year-old. If it was written by an adult they should probably just stop writing things already. Characters have voice powers that let you do voice things like influence people, cause mass hallucinations, or walk through walls....with their voice. The government pretends to be benevolent, but is actually an authoritarian regime that kidnaps children to turn into ubermensch in secret underground bunker-schools. Apparently, a race of psychic octopi are mind controlling the population as well. The overall message of the game, so far, seems to be that you shouldn't believe in conspiracy theories....yeah. \n\n\tAlso, the art style is blatantly ripped off of a 90's a cartoon called \"The Big Guy and Rusty\" right down to the new US flag and I don't see anyone talking about it. \n\n\tI first made a steam account in 2004 when I bought Half Life 2. I own hundreds of video games. This is the first game bad enough for me to bother posting a written review about. \n\nI do not recommend this game.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that this game thinks using a bathroom is gameplay. You press f to flush and q to wipe. That's just [i]weird[/i].",

There's too many cringey quips that aren't funny or engaging at all. They should redo it and cut out 90% of the fluff.\n- There's not much \"game\" in here in the 1.5 hours I played. Walking around pressing E to change a shirt or read a silly blurb about a chocolate isn't gameplay. All I really got the chance to do was briefly hit some shadow people with a bat then play a bit of guitar hero. Give me more things to do please. If you rather want to tell a story then make a show or a movie, not a game. You might say \"OK but we're setting it up give us a chance\" then don't start the story off being so damn obscure. Start it off interesting and get me hooked. This start meanders around with no point and I couldn't get invested.\n- The dialogue options/prompts seem meaningless. I had times where I had a choice then I picked something and it would give me the next choice down the list anyway.\n- If you ignore QTEs then you have to listen to more cheesy filler dialogue, so never ignore them.\n- I wanted to hear more about the actual story but it's too buried under pointless filler and constant bad one-liners.\n- The characters are simply unlikable. I didn't find any of them to be endearing or interesting. Very problematic in a story-based game.\n- Some of us read fast and want to skip along. No option for that, why? I don't want to skip the story, I want to read more of it faster, not at a snail's pace. I lost interest having to sit and wait.\n- Characters keep getting symbols popping above their heads and in the top left there are cryptic icons flashing as you play. Having this stuff explained would be nice. Do it immediately. I don't know what a person with a shushing symbol on them looking all wizardy and mystical means when I choose an option. Did I pick the wisdom route? The censored route? Did I pick the keep quiet and listen to others option? I don't understand.\n\nIn summary, this is a hard pass. If I had found even a tiny bit of something interesting to hold onto I'd have not refunded. There are better \"story/novel games\" out there. Go play them.",

One being a black guy coming out from prison with depression and regret but is very loyal, one being a gay man from the Yugoslavian war who the main protagonist knows from those times but is kind and sticks with you, and the latter being an insecure steroid junkie who doesn't know what way he swings but still is a fun guy to be around but this is not forced and rather shown through humor or hints like the dialogues which makes it seem more authentic. Not to mention: [b][u]THEY ARE LIKEABLE.[/u][/b]\n\n[h3]''The Priest''[/h3]\n[u]Ragnar T\u00f8rnqvist[/u] is the sinner of all sinners and he is the founder of Red Thread Games. He himself has said that he wants more ''inclusion'' and less ''white'' people even in his own damn dev studio. He wants as much artificial inclusion as possible instead of actually making a great creative work. He is Norwegian and caucasian himself yet he justifies this perverse self hate onto his own company and game studio. Absolute anti-social and vile behavior. He is a Judas and a disgrace of Norwegian heritage on the same line as Quisling by the way he tries to push his views onto people.\n\n[h3]Summary:[/h3]\nAbsolute pathetic display of globalist and modern experimental mindset of how these extreme leftists think. That is, acting condescending, pushing people down, forcing others to comply with their beliefs, forced inclusion and hints of immigration and replacement agenda.\n\nThis isn't a game, it's a non-game. It's a propaganda piece and was funded through the Norwegian Film Institute, the EU and our tax money by our government. Absolutely despicable. \n\n[u][i]Do not get this game. Refund it if you do. Don't give these globalist shills and traitors any money. They hate you.[/i][/u]",

Its an Interactive drama that acts like Life is Strange, just replace time travel with letting the game just talk to unlock the ideal choice to continue the story. There are moments where combat is involved think of God of War: Ragnarok but very basic and instead of a magic axe its a magnetic bat like JunkerQueen from Overwatch... You also get to play a Clone of RockBand, and Luigi's Mansion/ Ghostbusters.\r\nYou can see I'm referencing other games, and that is because its quite clear the dev team only took things they like from other games and put it into here. This wasn't even the biggest glaring issue. After Chapter 5 or 6 it became quite clear the amount of money or time wasn't enough, because the last five chapters were rushed, just avoid playing this game unless you have a reason to. \r\nThere is no real story or world building and context means nothing. You are just given the pieces and its on you to try to make it fit. The sanest thing to do is to just overlook it only to see that the game devs really overlooked everything else to focus on the dialogue that again has no meaning because of lack of context. \r\nImmersion never really happened all I could think was \"I don't know what the hell is going on.\"",

        "review": "I wanted to give the game a fair shake. This isn't me blindly jumping on a hate train. I've never left a review for a game before, but I'm dropping by to air my complaints so far. I will likely edit this later, as I only have 3 hours of playtime.\n\nIn those 3 hours, the game has crashed twice. My laptop is brand new, and no other game I've tried has just spontaneously shut down like this. I don't think I should be having a crash almost every hour. The fact that you can't skip cut scenes or dialogue means I was having to sit through conversation that I had just listen to a few minutes ago. The crashing wouldn't have been as much of an issue if I could skip what I had already seen.\n\nI've done 3 of the rhythm mini-games so far. The mechanics are fine, nothing new. I don't like the first song, which definitely isn't a great first impression. The lyrics are lackluster, and the vocals aren't very appealing. \n\nThe character designs are... okay. Pax's tattoos are a little too busy, and don't always play nice with her t-shirts. A tank top would've kept her arm tattoos from looking like part of her sleeve. I like Noam's look, but even so, I can admit that their clothes don't look appropriate for a heist. At least, not a cross-country one where everyone is living out of a bus. I get that it's because they're well-off compared to the others, but it's a little impractical. No notes for Theo, he's good. I like his stupid glasses. Sai, however, is not good. It's NOT because she's overweight, that has nothing to do with it. Her hairstyle is a poor choice, aesthetically and with the game's models. Her braids are often floating a few inches away from her shoulders like they're suspended pieces of plastic. Her vitiligo is tinted purple for some reason, which makes it look more like paint splatters than the actual condition. The knee-high socks are not flattering, and that wouldn't change even if Sai were skinny. A different hairstyle, no tall socks, and more realistic coloring for her vitiligo would have been enough to improve her design immensely.  \n\nThe banter is very Marvel-esque, and I'm very burnt out on that style of comedy. There were one or two jokes that made me laugh, but most of it was just very bland. The voice acting isn't stellar, and the characters come off as quite mean to each other a lot of the time. If I'm playing a game that focuses on relationships, I don't want to feel like my supposed friends are constantly bickering around me. Sai is a volatile, emotional wreck that has stated at least once that she hates Pax. Noam comes off as a sarcastic and petty person. Pax has multiple dialogue choices that are blatantly labeled as \"interruptions.\" Theo, despite being older, is a spineless punching bag for the entire introduction as he's being yelled at by everyone. I'd pay money to see him bite back at one of the crew for being immature. God, there's even a scene of Sai mocking Noam like a child.\n\n(Slight spoilers ahead, if you care.) And, even with the names of the abilities aside, I really don't like that everyone seems so comfortable using their powers against each other. Noam gaslights Pax, once with permission but once without so far. Pax can use her voice to silence everyone more than once, and also uses it to force Sai to come out of an anxiety spiral. Sai might not be using her powers to get what she wants, bit some of her tantrums feel a little manipulative. Right now it seems like they're all comfortable trying to play each other... except for Theo. Guy's just trying to wrangle three characters that feel like angst-riddled and emotionally unstable teens. You can even make choices that nudge him into a more fatherly role in the crew, despite the fact that everyone is 30+. Not sure yet why he even chose to team up with the other three when he could've probably done this much easier by himself. Sai has been a bit of a burden, while Pax is aggressive and hijacking the plans to suit her own needs. Honestly, if Theo needed an Anomal so badly he could've just brought the gaslighter Noam along without the others to help confuse any guards that might stop them. \n\nContinual Crash Update: 5 crashes in 4.5 hours\n\nTLDR: The game has crashed twice in my ~3 hours of playtime, and I have way more negative things to say than good. Will edit if I can make it through the game without more issues. 3.5/10 stars.",

These products don't necessarily have to bring in consumer dollars because the companies already got paid by an army of NGOs and government programs. \n\nThough the flow of ESG cash has slowed dramatically ever since central banks started raising interest rates there's still a long list of projects that were initiated several years ago that are finally being released today.   This is why, despite the complete public rejection of woke propaganda and dying ESG, we are still being inundated with far-left media.\"...\n\n...\"We recently discussed the exposure of a AAA video game called 'Dustborn' funded by the Norwegian Government and the EU.  The game features a cast of queer activist characters that use the \"power of words\" to cancel and manipulate their opponents.  They also use various methods to bully their allies to do more for them.   The game is set in the near future of 2030 in a balkanized America run by \"white conservative fascists.\" The backdrop of the game was apparently inspired by the 2020 elections.\"...\n\n...\"In 2021 members of Congress wrote a complaint to the GEC in which they argued that the institution was straying from its original mission.   They included the video game project, noting that it was designed to: \n\"Produce a \u2018counter-disinformation video game\u2019 that programmed audiences to associate citizen critiques of government waste, fraud, and abuse with a social media disinformation campaign.\u201d     \nInoculation Theory upholds that \"individuals who are exposed to weakened versions of arguments against currently held attitudes formulate resistance, and the ability to form counter-arguments to future threats to those attitudes.\"\"...\n\n...\"To simplify, they portray weak strawman arguments within popular media to make their political opponents look ridiculous.   The public consumes this media and is thus convinced that the government narrative is the proper narrative, while anyone who dares challenge that narrative is automatically ignored, even if their position is based on facts and evidence.   The US government is using American tax dollars to pay for psychological weapons that will be used against American citizens.\n\nThis agenda to infuse woke ideology into every aspect of western culture has been ongoing for quite some time, but any criticism of it in the past was immediately called \"conspiracy theory.\"   Only in the last couple of years has the evidence mounted to the point that even normies can no longer deny it.\"\n\nLITERAL\nGOVERNMENT\nPROPAGANDA...\n\navailable right here on Steam, along with many, many other games with similar propaganda motives.",

[spoiler]The bar scene alone is pure gold.[/spoiler]\n[*] Notwithstanding other criticisms I might have, the authors picked the end at an emotionally correct spot.\n[/olist]\n\n[h3]Neutral[/h3]\n[olist]\n[*] The game takes place in an alternative reality version of the US. I would have loved a bit more information on the setting or I would have loved the setting to influence the narrative a bit more. At the end it mostly used as just set dressing. [spoiler]For example taking what happened at the end would have triggered a war between two major players in the setting.[/spoiler]\n[*] Inconsistent voice direction. Some scenes have the proper emotional gravity, elsewhere characters have casual conversations in the middle of combat.\n[*] The game feels rushed. The last chapter feels like it should have been at least three chapters.\n[*] [spoiler]While the execution of Sai's betrayal and reversal is believable and well acted, it is placed too late in the story making Sai's reversal just another deus ex machina.[/spoiler]\n[/olist]\n\n[h3]Negatives[/h3]\n[olist]\n[*] The writers absolutely faceplanted on the big, macro stuff:\n[list]\n[*] There is a distinct political leaning presented, which is driven across to the player with a subtlety of a velociraptor in a kindergarten. Which is a shame, as at the core of this game lies an intriguing concept of how language can be constructed and how it can influence our perception. For a good example of how to discuss such politically charged themes would be the original Deus Ex.\n[*] The writers make an easy mistake several times in a very basic aspect of story-telling. Instead of \"B happens because of A happened\" they went with \"A happens then B happens\". [spoiler]Especially obvious in the structure of chapters 6 and 7. In chapter 6, even though CT has no problem seeing the road, the bus hits something that she is not able to identify exactly where the plots needs the characters to stop. (She should have seen the robogorilla and swerve out the way.) A small girl who is supposedly afraid is not guarded by anyone and runs off into a storm without protection, because the story needs the main character to be stranded alone for a horror fake out. In chapter 7, the bus breaks down just in front of an abandoned house that has just enough food for a group this big with fuel that is seven years old that did not go bad and so on.[/spoiler] There are just too many conveniences to constantly not get pulled out of the story.\n[/list]\n[*] The cast of characters is too large:\n[list]\n[*] Some of the characters like [spoiler]Sol and Ophelia[/spoiler] don't get anything to do and leave the story as they entered.\n[*] [spoiler]Nainai is used for a single joke five times.[/spoiler]\n[*] [spoiler]Girl is only used as a plot device.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n[*] [spoiler]There are two character deaths in the game. While I could see CT's death as being earned if it had been better executed, Theo's death is an absolute joke. It feels as if the writers decided to put Theo's death in last minute to add some gravitas to the final \"boss fight\" against another \"not a character that showed up five seconds before they were dispatched\" Axiom.[/spoiler]\n[*] Virtue signaling is, unfortunately, alive and well:\n[list]\n[*] At one point after the squad added a short person, I jokingly noted (I am glad that I streamed this to have evidence) that we are now only missing a person on a wheel chair, which was added a couple chapters later...\n[*] At some points there is a pronoun discussion which in itself is fine, until the characters of the main crew misgender (rarely) or assume (consistently) the gender of others.\n[*] For a couple of chapters at the start, the game tries to pull the same BS as Batman did a while back: [spoiler]\"We are not the bad guys. We are just knocking out these people. These baseball bats are not lethal. None of them are dead. Honest.\"[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n[*] Combat is pitiful. There is no threat to loosing all health. There is little to no time pressure to execute moves properly. There are no specific counters required to combat a certain mix of enemies. Combat animations lack weight. While the team combos and the \"whale on one dude\" attack adds a bit of flavor, there is not enough of it to pull combat out of the gutter. A better option would have been to leave it out of the game. (I chose the \"I want more combat\" option.)\n[/olist]",

Didn't set my world on fire, but the characters are likeable. (Sai is like me FR. Down to the size and the fact I'm the 'Can you do this heavy lifting?' gal of my friend group. Wish I had her superpowers), I really enjoyed the way dialogue is handled. (More like pushing people to certain places, rather then a 'Likes you/doesn't like you toggle.) and I like the overall vibe. It's unique in this market. Solid 7, maybe 8 outta ten. The only real complaint I have is that Pax, the main character starts out unlikeable and while I get that's the intention and I'm glad she gets called out on her behavior, her interactions, especially with her sister, that you're kinda rail-roaded into, left a sour taste in my mouth. Though I am willing to see where this is going. Again, it feels very purposeful.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying my time with the game and looking forward to where things are going.",

None of the characters in the game is in a particularly good spot when the game begins. That is understandable, even if it is unpleasant at times. \nEven though they are friends, and in this mess of a situation together, they are very isolated and don't necessarily know how to connect with each other. It was really rewarding to me to see them learn how to listen and empathise, even if they disagree. All of this happened slowly over the entire runtime (~20 hours) of the game, so it never felt aprupt or forced.\n The conversation system and the other ways of interacting with the cast of characters really shone for me. \nDustborn lets you play your main character with a wide range. Are you going to use your Vox powers at the first possible moment or are you trying to minimize its use? Are you going to only look out for yourself or make room for others needs?\nAre you going to be abrasive in conversations or take the time to listen? \nDepending of how you play your cards, situations will be different, and so will the relationships in the game - for better of for worse. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and am looking forward to playing a second run after I've let the thoughts swirling around in my mind settle for a bit. \n   \n",

        "review": "[h1]This Review is Thoughtcrime and Backseat Devving[/h1]\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the game, no one seems to be able to accurately describe the game's politics. I'll take a stab at it:\n[list]\n[*]The American Republic is a capitalist police state, but Justice cops support diversity for non-Anomals while hypocritically discriminating against Anomals. This means the American Republic could represent cop-loving liberals like Eric Adams or Democrats who sided with Republicans in post-9/11 surveillance policies. True libfash representation. The mainstream and far-right doesn't care for diversity optics as much as Justice, so Justice doesn't map to them.\n[*]Justice officers are treated as mostly well-intentioned and humanized people in a bad system, who aren't aware of their leaders' intentions, making this a nuanced example of cops.\n[*]That said, Justice cares more about sounding politically correct than applying anti-bigotry consistently, and they still persecute the homeless and protestors.\n[*]Justice's higher ups in particular [spoiler]want to capture and use Anomals as tools of control[/spoiler].\n[*]It's possible the JFK alt timeline nerfed the Southern Strategy, lol. Plus, it looks like some parts of the south seceded anyways.\n[*]Misinfo is represented as Echoes and misuse of Protolanguage, which can bend reality. The idea is that propaganda warps people's perception of reality, like convincing them liberals and leftists are the same. I find this a bad plot device because it takes away agency from humanity unlike real propaganda and I would prefer a proper examination of real propaganda techniques, including how misinfo can be produced quicker than real info. It's the Curse of Erebonia 2.0.\n[*]The far-right isn't represented in any major faction, but traces of their ideology are found in Echo infectees. Again, my problem with this is the lack of agency and the overemphasis of Echoes' paranoia inducement. Also, I don't think paranoia is the sole motivation of far-right ideology.\n[*]Since Echoes are caused by the Republic's experiments, this means the writers could be blaming the rise of the far-right on liberals.\n[*]The Puritans seem to be a mishmash of capitalist techbros, religious zealotry, and overcensorship in the name of fighting misinfo. I'm not sure what these guys map to. I guess some kind of hypothetical technofascism? They're treated with less sympathy than individual Justice officers, but they also don't seem to be as bigoted as certain factions IRL.\n[*]The Henry and Betty quest is meant to be a criticism of capitalism because the robots are given sentience and family-friendly lore, but are still treated as disposable tools by their creators. It's such a sad predicament that the robophobic protag feels class solidarity with these robots.\n[*]In Issue 2, the game criticizes anarcho-primitivism for some reason and believes that leftism can and should exist alongside technology.\n[/list]\n\nThe game seems to have a \"great power, great responsibility\" aesop in regards to both Vox usage and normal words, since both can shape the people around you. However, the choice system doesn't express this point consistently. It is satisfying to find Voxless solutions to reconcile with people and to pick choices that make Pax's friends happier. I also like how the game notices if you're listening to the crew's words as much as possible, with this method being considered the proper use of language. However, the game has mandatory Vox usage that serve as tutorials for new Vocal abilities, and many of them feel forced and harmful, other than Normalize. I personally feel like those trying to play Pax with good choices are being cheated by not having a choice in these situations. Yes, Pax has her own flaws to overcome, but in that case, I would prefer if the game didn't give the illusion of choice in those situations, or at least make her take more responsibility for these moments. Having forced harmful choices between stretches of good makes Pax's character development feel inconsistent. My recommendation is to have tutorials in Pax's Protolanguage dreams, leaving Vox use in the story up to the player's discretion.\n\nWhile I like the Librarian coda outcome for Pax because it's the most consistent with the writer's stated values, I feel like the final chapter was way too rushed. We don't know what the Herald of the Axiom is and we only get brief summaries of everyone's life after the heist.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\n\nThe game is advertised as action adventure, but the combat is so sparsely distributed that it feels more like a minigame than the actual music minigame. Additionally, while Pax's resource loop is fine on paper, her attack speed and bat hitboxes need to be increased to make the combat more satisfying. Finally, guarding and countering seem to be a thing, but it's also impossible to tell which enemy attack patterns can actually be guarded.\n\nAs for her Vox usage in battle, having certain party members enables combination attacks, with Hoax/Eli being one of the strongest in terms of sheer anti-human DPS. Sadly, party members aren't always available and I feel like not all combination attacks are created equal. Also, I think it's a missed opportunity to not be able to take control of other party members directly, since part of the game's puzzle-solving involves learning your allies' strengths.\n\nThe music minigame uses two axes, which can make it difficult to judge which note is closest. However, the next line is always highlighted in a unique color, which can help with snap decision making. Unfortunately, boost mode increases point gain while taking away the color indicator for the lines, making it harder to determine the next note. The only consolation is that the two axes design correlates with the face buttons on a controller and the timing is suprisingly generous, making it easy to get used to this UI.\n\nI did enjoy the non-combat puzzles, since they require you to think about each party member's abilities and how to use the various items you find. While you can brute force some of them with Sai, I like being able to find more intellectual solutions, like finding the code to move the fake trailer in Issue 3.\n\nThe game's dialogue system is in real time, with time creating and removing choices. It's an interesting approach, but there needs to be a visible timer for how long a choice will remain available. As for the game's coda system, Pax's coda gains need to be visible like everyone else's, since some people are achievement hunters.\n\nIMO, the game would be better as an Ace Attorney style visual novel to play to its strengths. Or maybe make the turn-based RPG minigame the main battle system so that you don't have to worry about fine-tuning hitboxes and speed. Sometimes, less is more.\n\n[h2]Other[/h2]\n\n-The first impression would be better if the Purity raid was done at the start as a proper playable section, since it builds up the group's initial conflict better and has combat. Starting in the middle of an argument instead of the true beginning of the adventure is bad.\n-Dialogue choice games NEED MANUAL SAVES.\n\n[h2]Verdict[/h2]\n\n7/10\n\nThis game is a very mixed bag for me, since the game feels like it's only enjoyable if you pick nice choices, but less enjoyable when you're railroaded into Vox tutorials or if you deliberately pick mean choices. Is there even a narrative point to the moral choice system? Also, I feel that the portrayal of misinfo as literal magic actually downplays its real threat and how effective it is at exploiting preexisting feelings and biases. As for the villains, I suspect they are meant to be libs who committed too much to their right/center policies while performatively supporting some minority rights. However, I feel like it downplays how bad the justice system actually is. I know my review is harsh, but I hope my criticism is more constructive than all the reviews either glazing the game or malding about it.",

        "review": "Dustborn is a dialog heavy game with some simple combat on the side. The story is surprisingly slow at times for such a dialogue heavy game, instead focussing more on the character interactions. As such, whether you will enjoy this game depends on whether you like you the cast of the game or not.\r\nThe cast of the game is the playable character, Pax, and her 3 companions, Sai, Noam, and Theo. As you play further, the Dustborn crew growths, adding a wide variety of characters. You also influence the characters with your decisions, even being able to push the initial cast of characters towards three different directions (like buddy, dad, and boss in Theo's case).\r\nThe dialogue is very slice of life style a lot of time, having the characters talk about whatever topics that come up or situation they find themself in, while also sharing stuff about their privat life. I enjoyed listening to the banter between the characters, finding their jokes and comments regularly amusing.\r\nThe story of the game feels slow, putting the focus more on the roadtrip with friend aspect, but it has its moment. I do have to say that after finishing it, while it has interesting elements in its story, it feels like they never fully realised them in the end. The last chapters of the game feels like they had to either cut their initial plans short or like they were rushing to create an end for all the things they sat up. \r\nOverall i found the game an enjoyable experience and recommend it, even if it has its flaws.",

        "review": "The game is drowned in completely, 100% misleading steam tags, but in reality has quite a few good things about it. Like seriously, there is nothing here that deserves LGBTQ and Political tags more than literally any other AAA game released in the last 5 years.\n\nThe story quickly picks up pace and builds a curious and somewhat light-headed setting (which isn't bad, as it fits well with the comic book style visuals). Later on the story focuses more on the relationships inside your band - and that is where the game really shines. The whole dialog and character systems are really well made and end up feeling very natural and immersive with each character well written and unique.\n\nThe worldbuilding side of the story could use an expansion though. Even after completing the game all I can say about fractions are that one are some totalitarian bad guys, second are a good opposing force and the last one is... idk, flying robots? The intrigue of the main mystery is very well built to, but left to be too open-ended. I feel like the game would be an order of magnitude better with another 10h of playtime devoted exclusively to worldbuilding and the mystery of the Broadcast\n\nAh, and there is also combat and song minigames. Both fit very well into the story, but when I chose \"more combat\" option I expected to see actually hard bosses and enemies, but they were all pushovers which is a little bit sad because the basic mechanics of the combat are good.\n\nIn the end, the game turned out to be not what I expected, but still very solid.",

Good character design, solid graphics, good voice acting but fairly janky and unpleasant combat mechanics. Fortunately, said combat is anecdotal enough to not ruin the overall experience. Largely bug-free on release, and well worth the price with more than 15 hours of engaging content. \n\nOne of the hallmark of good fiction that focuses on dystopia is how well it engages with modern anxieties. This game has a bold but smart take on its politics- and a story centered on healing, kindness and found families, that'll resonate with the heart of most people in these trying, weird chuds-infested times. As an enjoyer of games like Life is Strange or Disco Elysium, it certainly did so with me :)",

Dustborn might be for you If you're looking for a janky, but charming, linear narrative game with light gameplay elements that's about 20 hours long.\n\nThe good:\n-Unique story\n-Good voice acting\n-Well written dialog. I think it captures how people are multifaceted. Like a friend that's great and cool to spend time with sometimes but also has an annoying side that you have to deal with.\n-The first 6 episodes (out of 10) of the game. Each is about 2 to 2 and half hours long with a good amount of content.\n\nThe bad:\n-You have decisions throughout the game, but they are dialog options. There's no real impact on the story, so this is a linear story without any real variation.\n-There is occasional combat in the game and it's not good. Plus, there's no failure state. If you go down in combat, you revive with no consequences.\n-The last 4 episodes (out of 10) of the game. Each is slightly over an hour long. Episodes 7 and 8 were good although short while episodes 9 and 10 were clearly rushed. It seems like they were under pressure to meet a deadline or funding was running out, so the last 2 episodes are rushed and try to quickly tie things up.",

        "review": "Okay, so I just finished Issue #3 and there's a lot going on here, so I want to get my thoughts down before I finish the game, (which I definitely will).  I don't know whether or not I would recommend it at this point.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack, so here's the good, the bad, and everything in between.\n\nThe combat is pretty terrible.  I like the concept, but the execution is just so bad.  The combat, in most examples, was way too easy and way too short.  I love the combat banter, but I hate how it keeps getting interrupted and restarted every time I use an ability.  Some of the dialogue really just feels shoe-horned in to get the point across.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point; I'm left-wing, liberal, and pretty heavily weighted on issues of social justice, but damn, was this heavy-handed.  I wish there was more game, less social commentary.  It makes the characters feel more like caricatures or that their existence is just to prove a point.  Quantic Dream hasn't done that before in their storytelling.  Each character has had their own vibe, essence, and motivations, even the 1-episode characters.  It may be that I'm not that far into it yet, but the side characters lack depth.\n\nAll of the bad guys didn't need dialogue that made them ideologically agree with the heroes.  The bad guys didn't need to be tolerable.  This made basically every combat or tense situation into a joke.  The threats didn't feel real and the bad guys that Pax & co. feared from for their lives, weren't all that intimidating.\n\nAlso, from a critical perspective, treating misinformation as a ghost or some supernatural entity mystifies its existence.  That takes a lot away from the issues and concerns that we have that are very real.\n\nThere are so many different elements to the game, not all of which are executed well.  I'm not the biggest fan of the minigames.  Leave the Molotov cocktail throwing to Jason Mendoza.  The rhythm game is nice, but overall confusing because at the first playthrough of a song, it's unclear which notes will come in which order.  It's much better, for us visual learners, if they all come down one track, like in Guitar Hero.  Also, the songs are basically in my favorite genres (Pop-Punk/Metal/Alternative) and I didn't love them, but in lore, it makes sense that they sound unpolished, so I'll give them that one.\n\nThe me-em is a fun feature, and easily one of the best elements.  [spoiler]  The ghost hunting is fun and reminiscent of TWEWY's scanning features and operating the vacuum in Luigi's Mansion.  [/spoiler]  I also like how the minigame builds upon your combat actions as you progress.  Another, similar point is that I love how exploration can give you more bat upgrades, or how finding more echoes can lead to finding gifts and upgrades.\n\nThey experimented with a new type of dialogue tree, which was a little frustrating, but also more realistic in terms of communication timing.  You can sit on a dialogue option for an unspecified amount of time, and if you do, then one of two things will happen: 1. You will get more dialogue options to use.  2. The speaker will get frustrated with your lack of response, and the topic will die there.  Personally, I suffer with social anxiety, and this type of gameplay is not fun for me.  Getting a time limit with a hidden timer and no other indication of mood almost seems unfair.  Sometimes, I'll be expecting another dialogue option and then the character becomes frustrated by my lack of response.\n\nSpeaking of the dialogue, there are two other issues that I have with it.  I really hate how you need to intentionally go slow through different areas to hear all of the dialogue.  If characters are talking and you walk past another dialogue trigger, the topic will just stop, and the next dialogue will start.  You can check it in the log, but you'd never be able to hear it again.\n\nAnother difficult point is operating Pax herself.  Sometimes you get the choice to determine how she acts, but other times, you're forced into situations that you, the player, wouldn't choose.  If one of your main objectives in the game is to hide your Vox, I hate that this game forces you to use it.  [spoiler] Even in the first mission in Issue #0, the game makes it excruciatingly clear that usage of Vox is risky. [/spoiler]  I'm used to playing games that let you control a character that may not align with your personality, but I don't like it when a game pretends like it's giving the player a choice when it's really not.\n\nI loved the mid-investigation puzzles.  This is very indicative of Quantic Dream's usual style; narrative, with progression soft-locked by small logic puzzles.  They're tough enough to feel like a real barrier, but easy enough not to waste too much time on.\n\nI like being able to call your crew members in the middle of the investigation phases.  It feels more like a group effort and less like it's just one person making all the decisions and the rest are just tagging along.\n\nSpeaking of Quantic Dream's strengths, I love the crew's characters.  They're all adorable little beans and I just want to hold them and tell them it's okay.\n\nSo far, these are just the scattered thoughts that I have on the game.  For a clarification, I don't know whether or not I could recommend the game or not.  There are a lot of new things being tried out and the end result feels wildly experimental and unpolished.  I don't hate it, but it might have needed a longer testing period.",

        "review": "Alright. Preliminary review gone.\n\nIt took me a week and 24 hours of playtime to finish the entire adventure. I suppose I'll start by thanking the whiny outrage tourists who made me aware of the game to begin with. Their inane brigading of the forums led to a news article that in turn made me realize that Red Thread Games had something new out that I'd completely missed. Tried the demo and enjoyed it enough that I prioritized buying and playing the full game.\n\nI'll frontload this with...\n\n[h2]Bugs and glitches (keep review date in mind):[/h2]\n- Two or three times during the playthough, I had to quit to the title screen and reload my save because an interaction node necessary to progress failed to spawn. An annoyance, but could be dealt with.\n- Fairly frequently, the dialogue in the subtitles doesn't entirely match the spoken voice lines. Presumably this is an outdated script after changes were made during recording.\n- There were a few glitchy animations that looked kind of hilarious, like Pax lifting another character off the ground only for that character to sink down through her arms.\n\n[h2]Visuals:[/h2]\nStrong, comic book-inspired and colorful visuals. Looks a lot more like a less gritty version of [i]Telltale's The Walking Dead[/i] than it does [i]Dreamfall Chapters[/i]. All the characters are very distinct with their own visual styles, and I really enjoy the comic book visual language being used to help show how the characters are feeling with little doodles popping up over their heads. [i](Question marks, exclamation marks, little hearts, sparkles, etc.)[/i]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nThe combat actually grew on me, although that might very well be in part because I picked \"less combat\" as the style at the start of the game. It's nice to have choices, and I feel like a got a good experience.\n\nIf I'd opted for more combat, I might have gotten more use out of maxing out the baseball bat skill trees, but combat wasn't why I was here to begin with. The way it was, it gave me some occasional breaks from the regular gameplay to beat up whatever fools decided to pick a fight.\n\n[h2]Music/Rhythm:[/h2]\nThe sing-along and songwriting sections were relaxed and cozy.\n\nThe actual concerts (and rehearsals) could sometimes be a bit stressful, but I quickly got better at both the minigame itself and memorizing the particularly fiddly sequences in some of the songs. I have 4.5% achievement to back that up. (And math tells me that 27% of players who've finished that issue/chapter got it.) I had fun with it, but kinda wish there were another song or two.\n\nThe background music by Simon Poole also set the mood well for the game, and that one Charlotte Heatherley song hit pretty well.\n\n[h2]Characters:[/h2]\n\nThe core characters are all pretty funny and interesting in their own ways. I don't know what the exact situation is with Pax, but most of the other characters that come along for the road trip have three archetypes available to them, and where they end up depends largely on how the player treats them.\n\n[b]Pax[/b] is obviously controlled largely by the player, but does have a predetermined past that influences how she's perceived and what her options are before the player gets the chance to shape her future.\n\nI kinda disliked [b]Noam[/b] after just playing the demo, but they grew on me for the duration of the full game. It was nice seeing how they developed and opened up. (On my particular path.)\n\nMy old review mentioned that [b]Sai[/b] needed to calm down (which she did). That comment's a bit funny in hindsight, though, since I basically forgot about it as the game progressed, until it became highly relevant to her story.\n\n[b]Theo[/b]... went from Boss to Dad to Buddy. I originally planned to keep him in the Dad archetype, but it was just much nicer to just be a friend to him.\n\n[b]Ziggy[/b], Pax's estranged little sister, was [i]really[/i] well written. Their relationship starts out extremely strained and easily feels like the most difficult one to navigate while making me really [i]want[/i] to.\n\nBeyond those, there are a handful of other characters introduced. A few of them have the same moldable character archetype situation as the ones already mentioned, while others are introduced so late in the story that the decision to either tie their futures to someone else or for them to be old enough that they already know exactly who they are makes complete sense.\n\n[h2]Story and choices:[/h2]\nThe game starts out immediately after a heist that went somewhat sideways. The core crew; Pax, Sai, Noam and Theo; have just stolen some data from The Purists and have to escape Pacifica and travel through the Republic in order to make it to the promised safety of Nova Scotia. So this is essentially a road trip game, where the gang's cover story is that they're touring the Republic as the Dust Born and have concerts they must perform at specific venues along the way.\n\nWhile the idea for the game was purportedly a response to Trump getting elected, the story spices things up significantly by letting JFK (i.e. a Democrat) be the one who put the US on the road to its authoritarianism in its world. The game did in fact not tackle to issue of how center-right liberals enable the far-right's fascism, and actually put some time into humanizing some ideological opponents of the Dust Born. I'm sure opinions will be split on how good of an idea that was, but I think it worked pretty well.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is the focus on fighting disinformation. Opinions will, again, be split on both the concept and execution, but I enjoyed it. Basically, an apocalyptic event in the game's past has left the world (and people in it) infested with physical manifestations of disinformation, which leads to all sorts of erratic and hateful behavior. I think it was handled well, but it could certainly have been fleshed out more if the game was longer. That same event also gifted/cursed most of the protagonists (and many others) with voice-based abilities (Vox), and the persecution they face are a part of why the characters are trying to escape to Canada.\n\nDustborn actually plays around with your expectations pretty well when it comes to dialogue and choices: the gift-giving system can punish you for not putting thought behind what you give to whom, and conversations (especially ones that involve the Vox super-powers) will often see dialogue options appearing and disappearing as other characters are speaking to you and move on to different topics. There's a time for quick reactions and a time for patience.\n\nI'm not sure how well it worked in practice, since I've only done a single playthrough so far, but the story does take a stand about how the journey's end should be the culmination of the choices made along the way. It sure felt a lot better than what Mass Effect 3 did, and I'm looking forward to having a go at some different choices in the future.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nBetween the rhythm game aspects, the combat, and the overall adventure game format, Dustborn tries to do a bit much. It does a great job with the most important part (adventure game), while doing passably well with the combat and thoroughly enjoyable rhythm game sections despite a disappointingly short list of tunes the band can perform. (Just four.)\n\nIn addition to the dialogue system, the characters are where the game truly shines. I got really attached to all of them, including the ones introduced late, and I'd love to see another game (or DLC) that involves at least a few of them.\n\nStrong recommendation for fans of the genre who [i]don't[/i] spend their days letting right-wing influencers tell them what piece of media they should be fake-outraged about in this moment.",

No technical issues. I would strongly recommend trying the demo if you are interested. Overall I liked this game and had fun.",

        "review": "This game is about a group of friends, on a roadtrip to safety trying to survive and pass through territory that is unfriendly to them. It's notable as a game features many queer people of colour as part of its main and its supporting cast. Often when we think of queer games, the ones that come to mind tend to be visual novels or dating sims. But a black and brown queer cast in an adventure game with combat? That's got to be a first! \n\nIt feels rare that you start of an adventure game where the engine is already running and your player character have pre-existing relationships with the other protagonists in the game but here it is. \n\nCombat exists in the game and while it is pretty core to the game and has depth. It is ultimately secondary to the story, working to inform the audience that you live in a fantastical alt-history world and it's a little violent in territories of the Divided States of America.\n\nIt does sometimes feel like it could be more but that's okay, because unlike the Action Adventure genre, its main focus is to support the core mechanic of the game which are the relationships you have with your friends/crew/family. It is not the goal in and of itself.\n\nEven the powers these heroes have which are used in combat and in narrative choices have a purpose. Some of the characters feel ashamed about their powers because they only seem to harm others for short term gains, it all has a cost when you use it.\n\nThis applies to all the various minigames, (some of them being one off) because all those minigames you play exist to support the experience of what it's like to be on a roadtrip. They'll be moments where you're writing songs performing songs, doing a pull puzzle... They're not all as polished as they could, but they do serve the story and the characters.\n\nAs a game it has great and lovable characters (Love Sai!) who are all too human in their flaws, prejudices and their ability to grow. It's saddening to see the amount of harassment these devs have received from others who don't appreciate the heritage of adventure games Red Thread Games comes from.\n\nfor they're missing a real gem of adventure narrative story telling. Don't sleep on this!\nI enjoyed my time and can't wait to finish this game!",

At the beginning, these Crew don't win a price for sympathy - but with every decision done within the game (I do the \"Mr. Niceguy\" decision chain, try to avoid violence and rudeness), they start to like each other and at the end, it feels like they really are a family. Nice touch. I guess, there is no way to avoid killing the Justice Guys by the decision chain and [SPOILER] no way to rescue Theo[/SPOILER] - Which is a shame. There should be an Easy mode on these \"Guitar Hero\" minigame, I fail so badly. \n\nThe Game itself is a bit \"special\", to say so - It is more like an interactive Movie, I got an experience like this with the \"Game\" 198x, which use a similar style. So if you are not into listening to looooooo~~ong conversations and focus more on pure action, this game isn't for you, but if you like to get an interesting story told, you should give it a shot.\n\nFor people who wonder, why the \"Band\" is doing so bad in writing lyrics for their songs: Hey, they are not a band, they are smugglers making up a cover story and Pax is writing songs on the go between the \"Gigs\", so I think, it should be like this. Remember the Beginning? They introduce these cover story with sentences like \"But we should hold the Instruments right at least\" :) \n\nI wish, there will be a chance to try out some more choices without completely replaying the game. \n\nStill got some questions left here:\n\n[SPOILER]\n- Why Zee don't join at the end? \n- Sai, the best friend of Pax is a traitor? Can't believe... \n- Why the *** they kill Theo? I really liked him :)\n- How many Songs I can unlock?\n- How many endings are possible?\n- Is there a possibility to WIN the Battle of the Bands Contest in these futuristic city?\n- What is on this dang USB Stick? \n[/SPOILER]\n\nAlright, thanks to the \"makers\" of this game for around 17h of entertainment - 30 EUR well spent.",

The characters were relatable, distinctive and so diverse and I was invested in what happened to them. I enjoyed the variety of things to do in this game (exploration and choices with Guitar Hero and Ghost Buster and X-men vibes) and while I feel like more of the lore and character development could've been explored and wrapped up better in the end, I'm happy I played this. I get that this isn't for everyone, but the Black female protagonist and queer representation meant a lot to me and the chill road trip and found family/band of misfits aspects were what really sold it for me. The characters were flawed and introspective and felt real and were allowed to just exist. The twist on political history was interesting. The comic book visuals were fun. The voice acting was excellent. As someone who is hard of hearing, I appreciated the subtitle/accessibility options. I played the combat on easy because combat isn't a priority for me. It was pretty user friendly, though there were a couple of times I had to exit the story due to glitches. I do wish there was an easier way to go back if the choices didn't have the desired effect and for the life of me I couldn't score that high on the musical bits, but overall I had a great experience and I enjoyed it. I think the characters and their stories will stay with me for a while.",

        "review": "When I first saw the game announcement and a trailer I was like Joe Pesci in 'Casino' with: \"What the fuck Is this piece of shit?\" But, since Dreamfall is one of my favorite series and I kinda enjoyed Draugen, I wanted to support Red Thread Games and Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist. So I bought it.\n\nCoincidentally, not long before I played it, I watched Alex Garland's 'Civil War', that is also a road adventure in alternative USA (way more realistic and down-to-earth), and Dustborn is more of soft sci-fi dystopia. I kinda like all that alternative reality stuff, so the story kept me engaged.\n\nIf you enjoy Telltale and Dontnod games nothing is going to surprise you here. So, the emphasis is on story, and things like gameplay took a backseat. All you do is walk and talk basically, also there are an easy rhythm game and an easy combat system. \n\nI love the Dreamfall OST so much and this one was made in a very bad taste. Music, unfortunately, is extremely horrible, and it's especially sad that it's been stuck in my head for days. That only applies to the music the characters play, the rest is okay. And, yes, by the story the characters are not musicians and only pretending to be a band, but c'mon, this is some kind of a torture music.\n\nCombat is pretty primitive and boring, but after the first fight it gives you an option to choose a focus on a story - fights will be shorter and easier and you don't have to waste time on it, that is good, I guess. I believe it's a peculiarity of this genre to have some shitty sloppy action sequences.\n\nThe thing I liked is the social mechanic. it's not like the aforementioned Telltale/Dontnod and whatever games, where at a certain moments you just choose A or B and it will decide the fate of the characters. Here it goes throughout the game as a result of communication with them, so they lean one way or the other (every character got like 2-3 traits they can lean to) and the endings of their stories will depend on how you affect them by communication. And as a surprise (soft spoiler warning for 5 people that might play it) in the end it turns out that your main character also had that traits, but hidden, so the main character made final decision by herself based on your actions throughout the game and you don't have to choose A or B ending. I think it was an interesting approach and well-suited for this kind of games.\n\nThe visuals, which at first I really didn't like at all turned out to be not so bad. Game has nice locations, you can change angles during dialogs, I love when you have that possibility and, overall, the visuals were pretty enjoyable for the most part. But on the other hand, the game has one of the worst character costume designs I've saw (when you'll see the bikers and Eli you'll understand). I'm sorry, but it is just horrendous. \n\nAlso, it has some bugs, like characters repeating same stuff twice, a couple of animation glitches and at one point after some fighting my character model just disappeared, so I had to restart the game, but luckily the progress has been maintained. I'd say it's a very minor problems.\n\nThe story is fine, it kinda misses the world-building elements for me, like how did it come to this, what are the deal with all these fractions, why some wierd bikers gain so much power in certain territories, what happened in that often mentioned Broadcast event and why it happened, a lot of unanswered questions about the world, but they decided to go with a more character focused story instead. And the characters are alright, not perfect, dealing with their issues, but likable. All the voice actors did a good job. Yes, the are some eye-rolling moments here and there in dialog and as well as  plot-wise, but it\u2019s tolerable.\n\nDialogs have some problems, too much and too unfunny quips that characters made. Other thing is characters talk too much with each other so if you interact and interfere their dialog it might bug and they will repeat it all over again, so the advise probably would be to let them finish first.\n\nOverall, I got to say, that I had extremely low expectations. I thought I would just buy the game and never play it, but I decided to give it a chance. Certainly, it's not as terrible as people try to make it seem. it was an okay experience, so if you have a shortage of games of this genre, you can give it a try. Peace",

The writing is mostly good, but sometimes I honestly can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re being deliberately sarcastic and playing with their audience, or just unintentionally cringe and overly trying to hammer the point home. This most apparent when the band is performing, the songs vary from fine to terrible when it comes to lyrics, but thankfully it\u2019s not the main focus of the story, so it didn\u2019t bother me too much. The rhythm game tied to this however feels a bit off, and I think it could use some accessibility options to make it less frustrating or just easier, especially for rhythmically-challenged people like me.\n\nCombat is OK, but nothing to write home about, it\u2019s not terribly complicated and thought initially it can feel a bit chaotic, once you get a hang of the core mechanics it can be super easy. It\u2019s a nice intermission, that never stops being a little bit clunky. I did enjoy the combat banter a lot, however, and the fact that each character brings a unique synergy to the table.\n\nOverall, a solid 7/10. Played it mostly on Steam Deck and while the game is perfectly playable, it can chug at times in combat sequences. \n\nP.S. Dear devs, please add an ability to move dialogue forward by button press, I usually read quicker than the voice actors say their lines and waiting for them to finish can be a bit tiring.",

It reminds me of when I got The Longest Journey, which I pretty much lived and breathed for awhile.\n\nAs I dig deeper into this, I see the connections and I am hooked. I know now why the world is so well put together and I am here for it. \n\nJust having a lovely time with this game. Glad it exists.\n\nEdit: \n\nFinished the game and everything above still holds true. It's a wonderful joyride of a roadtrip through an alternative history America, where controlling others became the way to \"freedom\". \n\nA misfit of characters get together with the common goal of wanting to live in peace and not having to worry that they will eventually get caught by using their \"magical\" powers. \n\nA heist ends up in a journey of self-discovery, learning to listen to others, showing empathy and growing as a character. It's a game heavily leaning on character development of each character, which just gets me all smiley - I am a sucker for character development in games. Everyone is trying to find their place in the world, including just wanting to be happy and to be themselves. \n\nIf you are a fan of adventure games, great worldbuilding and want a hell of a story that keeps on giving, give this one a try.",

The government should not be funding games, especially not for political goals like 'fighting disinformation'. That's a totally reasonable complaint. But the story and gameplay have steadily gotten better after that abysmal first chapter.\n\nBut ultimately, the claims that the lead is a bad person aren't really hitting. Being good is the biggest challenge, yeah, but there are lots of games like that. Think Chloe Price in Before the Storm, or Trevor in GTA5. Or Astarion from BG3, who everyone swooned over. Heck, what about April Ryan in Dreamfall, after she had been so beloved in TLJ? I could go on.... Guybrush Threepwood, anyone?  \n___\nPretty good so far, though I can totally understand if someone feels the mechanics are too passive and simple. Also, as many have mentioned, the soundtrack is AWFUL, which is wild because the Longest Journey series had a brilliant soundtrack all the way through. Still, this is a great experience for fans of things like The Longest Journey, which I am. And there are little flavors of TLJ in there too.\n\nElephant in the room time. I don't care one iota about the political stuff. But yes, I can see that the characters are hyper-reesentative of... everything. I do want to point out that some people actually experience that in their friends groups, especially when they're queer. This crew looks like the kind of people Im usually around. Its not 'unrealistic'. But it may be so alien to you that you just can't enjoy it, and I get that. I feel the same way when I'm dragged into a religious service for whatever reason. I wish we'd quit trying to shoot down each other's media and just accept that we live in different worlds. That's all I'll say on that.\n\nPeace.",

        "review": "Before I start this review, I want to give a couple of disclaimers before anyone decides whether or not to purchase this game:\n\n1. Yes, there are plagiarism accusations towards this game. Whether that is true or not, that is unclear, but if that is something taken seriously, then you should probably stay clear of this game.\n\n2. The way that the game was marketed was rather misleading to a degree that trailers were potentially changed, altered, or re-updated and uploaded. Me personally, I'm surprised that literally no one has mentioned this anywhere, but I can understand if some consider that a serious matter. I'm not a fan of that personally, especially from someone who was genuinely excited and interested in this game at some point.\n\nNow for starters...\n\nIs this game as bad as people say it is? In my personal, subjective, opinion, no.\n\nBut, does that mean that the game is good then? No.\n\nLet's start with some of the positives first:\nWhen the game is not focusing on too many themes at once, too many ideas, too many plot points, etc... When the game decides to take a back seat, this is where this game actually shines. The times between stops on the road when you are sitting by a campfire, at a party, in a house, etc... these parts of the game stand out as being generally good. The game really gives that time to just get invested in characters, the world, music, and so on. Speaking of which, the music parts of this game are fairly enjoyable to play through, whether for the right or wrong reasons. Even during these parts of the game, there is an admittedly clever item system in which you can influence characters this way, which gives some good incentives to explore levels, as well as becoming a factor of the game that is admittedly pretty interesting. Speaking of which on a final note, despite the language used in this game, which don't worry we'll get too, the theology aspect of the game is admittedly an aspect of the game that was somewhat enjoyable, even though I think the game could go way more into this aspect.\n\nNow for all of the bad, and there is quite a lot of bad here:\n\nLet's start back to the premise of the game. This is a horrible way to make the characters likable. Not only is it a rather weak hook into the main narrative, but to top it off it makes me not like the characters from the start. Seeing the characters not like each other, arguing over nonsense, saying and doing whatever is on their minds, and then getting a cop accidentally killed on the road, ain't a good start to a story in which you are going to be with these characters, for the entire runtime of this game. And don't worry, for the most part, for the entire time, these characters ain't likable, except for the robot of all things.\n\nThen you get to the overall level design. It's very basic, cheap feeling, open but thin, and empty. Even when exploring for items, they seem quite out of place in relation to the setting, and that goes for the world building as well.\n\nWhy are there even robots in this world? Why does this game look the way that it looks with its art style, which just gets in the way of the UI and copies other games if anything? You have this seemingly dark serious treacherous world yet everything is bright, colorful, clean and tidy...What is even going on with the climate during the road trip? The way that the world is built up is not only confusing, but it goes against itself, it simply doesn't feel like a real world. Nothing feels organically made in this game, and it really took me out of the experience, and that is included with its inclusion of its themes as well as the way that other items and props are placed in the world. It's distracting honestly. And don't you forget, about the echoes, meme devices, powers, etc... It's so out of place that it honestly comes off as funny more than serious.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game tries way too hard to have too many ideas. There are great games out there, that handle similar themes to this game, but the difference is that they have a really large focus on very few ideas, and not focusing on everything to where you lose sense of the artistic vision that the game wants to convey. This feels like when a toddler has a lot of toys in a toy box, and they just dump the entire toy box on the floor, and they're like \"hey look at this look at that\"and that's it, in comparison to say having a few Lego sets, but you can do a whole lot with them, you can change what you build, you can experiment, you can push the boundaries of your imagination, you can make those Lego sets interact with each other differently, craft wholly unique stories, and the list goes on. Some of its themes are so poorly explored that its some of the worst writing in a game that is out there, and combined with what was previously mentioned earlier, and you have a compound effect of now having the aesthetic of a group of people posing as a band, but with its awful music, makes for an even more unlikable experience.\n\nThen there is the choice system. It's certainly unclear. Sometimes you're just forced to make choices that you don't like, or the choices in relation to the outcome doesn't make sense, feel too narrow, or are just moving the plot. It's just a bad choice system overall, in a game whereby it is super important.\n\nI'm not going to conclude any spoilers in this review, so I'm just going to skip over quite a few issues with the plot and go straight to the technical side of things. It's bad. The game doesn't run well for what it looks like, the way that the audio is mixed is terrible and the fact that you have to look at characters to hear them correctly is incredibly annoying, the overall UI is actually a nuisance, there are misspellings within the subtitles, the combat is buggy, glitchy, clunky, stuttering like crazy, even though the boss fights are actually pretty okay, and the voice acting is sometimes so bad that it's as if I'm hearing a straight up studio session.\n\nI didn't, besides within the combat, run into technical issues per say, but this game is more so on a bad technical level when it comes to its production more than anything.\n\nOverall, I don't think this game is as bad as other people say it is, but it certainly isn't good, and I still think it's a bad game. I am going to give this game a 3/10.",

        "review": "Preface:\nFirst I want to say that I am so sorry that this wonderful game has gotten hijacked by gamergate/alt-right proponents that try to destroy every piece of media that doesn't reflect their ideological ingroup (or what they themselves look like). Their opinions and reviews were bought and paid for before the developers even started making this game, and they have been making them known here months before the game was even released. Most haven't even played the game, they just bought, reviewed, then got a refund; or they fill up the discussion forums with hate. These individuals are unwilling to think critically about the media they consume (or don't). There are discussion boards others and I made, addressing the misinformation and the actual politics of the game if you are willing to wade through the hate and misinformation to find them.\n\nMy Honest Review On The Story:\n\nThis story is very much a TLJ level game both in storyline and in theme, and as such, is fundamentally about ensuring the liberty, security and equality of ALL in the face of a governing body and corporate culture that intends to control or destroy them. It also grapples with the mystical ramifications/bleed-through such action has on their Logic/Chaos universe. The themes are similar to those found in Xmen, Star Wars & Star Trek.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the graphic novel art style & character designs. ALL of the characters felt very familiar to me, so you will get no criticisms from me there. They have a wide range of backgrounds, body types, ages, and conversation styles. I could see some aspects of myself in many of them that I don't typically see in canon media (even as a cishet white woman). I especially liked that the characters' outfits changed or were restyled as time passed (it was subtle but added to the realism in a way that even shows & movies rarely do). \n\nIt's important to mention that this isn't a story about race aside from Anomals; and doesn't address gender, sexuality, or religion outside of characters' identities. This is a different universe with different rules/prejudices/politics. I even liked that it depicted flawed people that can work on and evolve beyond their faults (and apologise), [spoiler] like Pax's fear of robots. [/spoiler]\u00a0\n\nI also enjoyed most of the dialogue including the Buffy-like fight banter (I used the shout menu to hear it all). The amount of dialogue and puzzle solutions was also impressive. I liked that this game's character approval mechanic felt the least manipulative. It was more like you were seeing where your friends were coming from, than trying to make them fit into your expectations. Character arcs can change dialogue and character trajectories (though in mostly subtle ways) it also gives you unique insights into their personalities. \n\n[spoiler] I liked that their powers were the unintended side effect of the powerful malevolent energy that attacked the US (The Broadcast), so their powers are a reflection of that even if they don't use them maliciously. E.g. Noam uses their power of \"Gaslight\" to sense another's emotions or to deescalate (panic attacks or acts of violence). Pax also doesn't like using her powers unless she has to because it is fueled by hatred (which is interesting for a playable character where you dictate their choices). [/spoiler] I also liked that teammates can use their powers on and with each other, even without being directed to (it gives them agency).\n\nI even liked the undercover fake band plot (and guitar hero-like mini games that you can continue to play in camp). The songs were basic punk/anarchy in style. Though I wish song choice affected the venue differently; and for the developers sake, I wish one had different lyrics (that couldn't be so easily misinterpreted).\n\nSpecific Critiques On Story:\n\nI don't think they started the story in a way that makes players empathetic to the characters or properly sets up the story. \n\n[spoiler] I hated it any time we were forced to use our powers, (especially in Sanctuary, and at the mall). Her powers might be fueled through hatred but using it as a tutorial or forcing it narratively didn't seem aligned with a game about choice, especially when the dialogue seemed unjustified. It would have been better if it presented us with a choice first but then an event forced Pax (who isn't just a player insert) to change her own mind later (it could also be an important moment to exemplify free will and choice; or if she was acting on knowledge that we didn't get confirmed yet [like protecting her baby]). [/spoiler]\n\nI might have written some parts differently, changed some terms & reorganised some scenes but it was never enough to turn me off of the story itself. \n\nAbout other legitimate reviews: \nSlow builds aren't a bad thing (neither is unanswered questions or mystery).\u00a0Though I definitely agree about the need for skippable dialogue, (even if it is more realistic). I can even agree that the pacing seemed off at times; though the reviews stating an overtly narrative driven story has too much dialogue is baffling to me. Many people also mentioned they didn't notice many changes depending on their choices but I wonder if that is because they are playing the characters to type.\n\nI also agree that the ending feels rushed, I also felt that way with Dreamfall Chapters (which broke my heart at the time). The creators really need to work on delegation and dispersing time and resources effectively going forward as it's not a pattern yet, but could be.\n\nMechanics:\n\nMost are perfectly serviceable. This, like many telltale games, is narrative first and game play by extension. I also won't gate keep what makes a game, a game. \n\nI also appreciated that the studio was willing to experiment with the limitations of the medium (more than even Telltale). It didn't always work out, but I still found them fun/interesting. It's impressive how many different mechanics they tried to implement given their budget. I hope they can refine and use what they built here on other projects.\n\nThe diversity of dialogue tree options was unique for this genre. For example: choices can come and go; you can choose whether or not to use your powers in conversations; your dialogue adapts upon acquiring new powers; you can even use other party members' powers to solve dialogue puzzles. All of which can change conversation trajectories. I also liked how gift giving was incorporated.\n\nCriticisms on mechanics:\n\nIt does need a lot of refinement (stilted & repeating dialogue, location bugs, characters & objects you can walk through, saves inconsistent). Updates can fix what should have been done if they gave themselves a few more weeks for game testing & marketing (though I can see why that wasn't possible this time around). \n\nI liked the time based dialogue options, but not showing what time remains while also requiring each option to be read, felt more anxiety driven then it needed to be (especially when dialogues can come and go). A better GUI is needed (like dialogue [comic] bubbles fading in or out). I also think Dreamfall chapters did this better with the inner monologue. \n\nCombat isn't great, but better than I thought (and much better than TLJ: Dreamfall). Fighting and blocking weren't as fluid as I would like, though I did like the team attacks. None of it was difficult but again it was more like a mini game then a narrative necessity. I appreciate they tried something different for the genre. You can always reduce or simplify encounters if you want. \n\nSaving & loading should have worked better, especially to quickly change unintended choices without consequence (because sometimes Pax would say something unexpected; or you'd missed an important prompt because you weren't fast enough). It would also help with replayability if save points were always after conversations ended or if players were able to manually save. \n\nIf you are not a member of the hate mob (especially fans of TLJ), this game is worth buying.",

        "review": "I am a Russian living in an oppressive, authoritarian state, one of the worst political regimes in existence. (Russia) A country kept in chains of fear and terror, immense poverty of struggling to meet ends meet, men and women enveloped by their throats and slowly, day to day, strangled by the hand of a flawed, aggressively violent system, slowly killing population\u2019s lives, draining remaining hope for peace and well-being. Ruled by a government focused on death and destruction of anything it touches, a gas-pipe blocked by rotting buildings could not be any further from more all-front degradation.\n\nIt chose a path of war against its own kind and even more so against its own people, putting everything at stakes, people\u2019s lives at stakes to protect its own ignorant, catastrophic and delusional oligarch monstrosities further terrorizing human lives. Civilians destroyed emotionally, lied to, children\u2019s mental health butchered as their lives are thrown to feed worms at the grounds of battles, as they lie with lost limbs, accepting their fates, pulling the trigger to put themselves out of any more misery. Misery that they have been born for, as they, like nothing but dust were thrown in it by their own parents or the state, as they have been inserted into the world of decay and injustice, as they, like blind puppies staring at the sun, bleeding out in cold death, stretching their hand against the light, block it by attempting to reach out. Some knew no concepts of love and freedom, as they have been kept in such darkness their whole lives, as they themselves sealed the light, as they did not know how to let it in. They\u2019ve never seen it, their eyes have been purposefully blindfolded. Living in the basement that this dark place is, eating their skin away by darkness, they could not know and see such light exist. Some knew such light, but were forced away from it. Others went into darkness willingly for other reasons. Many because words is all enough for them to be[b]lie[/b]ve. And some, gradually, every day see the light fade away more than it already has. The light is fading away, what is killing me. \n\nAt the end it was all fun and games, plays of the oligarchs all at the face of illusions of feeding constructs of greatness, self-importance, aimed at the population ignorant and oblivious enough about the world around to fall into the darkest pits. Others, their hands are tied, as they are forced to endure in a dark place along with them. This place is basking in cold darkness for centuries. Slave authorities prosecuting people speaking out against the terror consuming concepts of humanity, against those calling for peace. People have no rights here. There is no peace here and never was by no luck or by design. The weight of it all is enough to crush me.\n\nSociety is fed with a dangerous ideology, indoctrinated, blinded by constructs that they think are right, but leave nothing but ground of skulls. People contrary are prosecuted, be it they call for peace or display actually peaceful intentions. Draw a rainbow and it will be ripped apart. People around are too weak to see colors apart from black and white. I\u2026 I\u2019m tired of metaphors.\n\nAll this aside, I am just\u2026 Uh\u2026 I\u2026 I mean it\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? I am bisexual, I mean kind of gay, I mean everything. And I\u2026 I just can\u2019t, I\u2026 I am frustrated. Disappointed, sad, depressed. I hated that light and dark part, I hated writing that. It was about people being, well\u2026 Forced to kill or die, you know? Forced to be in the mess, to get emotionally destroyed, you know, you know? Ha-hahahahaha. Hahahahaha. Ahaha. I want my\u2026 I want\u2026 to\u2026 :p :P Listen, I\u2019m trying to\u2026 :d I\u2019m smiling. It\u2019s sad to me. I\u2019m smiling because it\u2019s sad to me. It\u2019s cuute, it\u2019s cute, xd. *kissies* I\u2019m just not feeling okay, okay? \n\nIt is no secret that this country is one of the highest in terms of mental illnesses. At the time of writing, this place is exceeding South Korea in suicide rates. That\u2019s because it\u2019s pretty awful. Rawr. Meow. Rawr, meow, yiff. Shall I lick my paws? \n\nI am a liberal and those conservative brainlets, they don\u2019t know what they are supporting. The only reasons why they are fascists is because of blind consuming hatred. Their hatred and their choices lead themselves and their children to decades of tyranny, to oppression. This is what they choose themselves and they suffer from it themselves. Play logic games with them and they fail, because none of them have comprehension of how the world and politics work. Remember that, conservative fascist trash. You get what you ask for and this is all going to be educational for all of you. Freedom is everything. If you can\u2019t handle freedom, perhaps you can handle slavery to illusions and constructs? All you can do is to support Trump, fall on your knees before him, kiss his feet and call yourself strong after that. That\u2019s not how the strong works. You never understood nothing.\n\nI support this game\u2019s political message. In the world where fascism is rising like never before it is important to have more games with free thinking agenda integrated in them. What\u2019s \"wokeness\"? Woke is being aware of the systemic issues. People with non-traditional orientation have been repressed, discriminated for ages. If you take away their rights, discrimination to them, abuse is inevitable. Ignorant people have been trained to think that it\u2019s bad, but that\u2019s because they are not awake and don\u2019t know what truth and freedom stand for. Humanity will learn a hard lesson if it slips into fascistic, conservative nonsense. Mark those words.\n\nPlaying this game, it\u2019s\u2026 Charming. Seeing those characters in bright clothes in front of camping fire playing their songs\u2026 It\u2019s so innocent. You see, the main characters, they behave the way they do to certain awful people is because there are so many awful people around. This is just how they are, you know? Righteous.\n\n[h1]Nothing is eternal, not even mountains.[/h1]",
