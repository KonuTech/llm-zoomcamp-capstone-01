But it has been ruined by live service and overly repetitive and not much story.\r\nFirst part of the game where there was story wasn't anything near the Arkham series, but it was ok.\r\n\r\nBut after episode 1 the game gets really boring.\r\n\r\nPositives:\r\n-Good idea (but bad execution. Idea of playing as Suicide Squad works, but it was done horribly)\r\n\r\nNegatives:\r\n-Repetitive missions\r\n-Boring story after first part\r\n-Live service that cuts down way too often and you have to wait for servers to come back online\r\n-New characters takes way too long to unlock unless you are wiling to pay for them\r\n-Combat system (it could have been good, if they would have taken what makes the characters unique, but they decided to add same mechanics to pretty much everyone)\r\n-Repetitive voice lines makes game annoying. Thats why last ~20 hours of the game I have played it muted.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n-Game could have been good, but they decided to get greedy and go with the flow that ruins so many other games.\r\n-If you get it in really good discount (Deluxe version around 10-15\u20ac) then I would suggest it just to try it, but anything above that is just way too expensive.\r\n\r\n1.5/5",

I was hoping the new seasons would give more to do, but unfortunately the story for each season is locked behind a long, tedious, repetitive grind. You can't access the dlc stories and continue progression unless you play through those same handful of boring side missions, over and over, until you reach a certain level. And, from what I've seen in videos, the dlc stories aren't worth grinding for anyway.  The terrible writing, voice acting, and tone of the new characters and stories kill any desire to slog through the repetitive grind to unlock.

        "review": "TL:DR Repetitive, Boss fights are boring, (run around for %60 of the time avoiding damage till a counter button pops up do damage repeat). You don't get to use any of your abiltys, your mostly just running around shooting bullet sponges till a counter button pops up so you can break shields to kill something. No repeatability. End game is you fighting the justice league over and over.\n\n(I hate to say this I really really really do but... Gender white washing) This is coming from a person who is their target audience. 'Young white female'. I like my heros and villians as they were. I don't know why their changing them out of no where.\n\nThe game was fun for a while, but the Guns are limited per hero. To do damage you have to keep up a combo meter till you get a prompt to hit a button to counter just to keep your combo up. And If you don't hit the counter button, the bad guys will have a shield that never brakes so they never die.\n\nYou're given quite a few abiltys you would think you can use a lot but the game wents you to be on the move non stop like it's trying to be Sunset Overdrive if you remember that game. And you are given task that have you try to use movement abiltys and some very hard to pull off slide that needs you to hit a button after you've been sliding for a very VERY specific time, and that abilty also has abiltys linked to it that they expect you to be able to pull off while fighting.\n\nI never cared about people picking sides with whats 'woke' and what isn't. But Story wise they are just making stuff up at this point. From Harlys point of view the game trys to make it seem like batman was the bad guy all a long to justify her killing him, same for deadshot and green lantern.\n\nMr Freeze is a woman now some how, and I haven't even bothered to play to see why that's even a thing. The boss battles are pretty boring after the first one and convoluted mostly consisting of you running for your life till your able to hit a counter button from time to time so you can stun the boss and do damage and then spend 60% of the time avoiding damage again and doing that 3 times for every boss fight after the first one.\n\nThe end game content is just you fighting brainiac versions of the justice league over and over for IMO no reason at all. The game has no real replay ability and is repetitive.",

        "review": "This game is not worth picking up, and I heavily advice against anyone picking it up. The gameplay is repetitive as heck, and none of the characters have any growth whatsoever in this so called \"story\".\r\n\r\nStory: This is a \"live service\", meaning you have to wait for more content to come out overtime. However, with what we got so far, it's nothing but absolute garbage. I will summarize what happens so as to not spoil it as best as I can, but it goes like this: The Justice League out of characteristically goes to Brainaic with zero precautions in \"good faith\" and gets corrupted. This corruption can't be undone and thus, three non-meta humans and one low-mid tier Metahuman criminals must \"kill the Justice League\". Now if you know the Justice League, you know for a fact the squad shouldn't stand a chance, and you'd be right: so in this game, every time the heroes have a chance to end the squad, they just...don't. The Squad has some of the biggest plot armor I have seen, not even Comic Batman can top it. Green Lantern captures you, and instead of finishing you off, takes you on a tour of the city, Batman leaves instead of finishing Harley off etc etc. This makes the story completely stupid because you know the game ended as soon as Lantern captured you guys.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacters: The Justice League is completely disrespected, minus Wonder Woman. Yes, this includes Batman from the Arkham series. Each of their deaths have the villains mock or even take the moral high ground over characters we know are 100% good. Even the game backs this up in the Museum. Green Lantern acts like a Police Officer instead of a marine and is left in his BOXERS as a laugh to a hero we've grown up watching. Batman is shown stalking the squad but never does anything whatsoever to impede them himself, he's also killing now as well. Did I mention they have Batman just..get shot on a Park bench? Superman is just...there. He barely talks, and he just...flops to the ground. Not even a single word during his death scene. Flash who saved the squad twice is almost...desecrated when he dies by Captain Boomerang, and they turn it instead into a JOKE. Wonder Woman is the only one getting sung praises about and the squad for some reason have a thing for *only her*. Speaking of, none of the squad have any growth whatsoever. They're the same at the beginning and end.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Very Repetitive, none of the characters are actually \"unique\". Only their Traversal is unique. You do the same mission over and over again. The joker pass is proof of this, as they made the grind long on purpose so you just want the pain to stop, so you pay money to get him early. Guess what? He plays just the same as the others. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Boring. The Skill trees are utterly pointless. The HUD is overflooded with too much, blocking most of your sight. Since you aren't playing as the characters you probably want to play as (Flash, Batman, Superman, Green Lantern) you have to fight them as bosses, and they aren't good. namely Flash/Superman, who will fly/rush all over the place making it too hard for you to hit them....Hmmm if only we were playing characters that actually stood a chance against the league.\r\n\r\nArt: the Artist/graphic designers who made this game deserves praise, because the details they made are spectacular. Metropolis looks beautiful, too bad their talent is wasted on a trash game.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong story short: Don't get this game: it disrespects not only the DC universe, but also the Arkhamverse. We should have gotten the Justice League as a game instead.",

Is this really a game developed by the developers of my beloved Arkham Series? \n\nThe game's tutorial wanted me to return the title immediately but then I thought come on give it a try it cant be that bad. For starters: I bought that game on an 80% discount (19,99\u20ac). I dont even know where to start. Lets start with the combat. This game was made by the company who created the - in my opionion - best combat system in a superhero game -> the freeflow combat system; this system from the Batman Arkham games is till today superb and they exchanged that\nwith this weirdly mess of shooter gameplay?... oh boi. \n\nbest part of my 2h session: introduction of Batman was amazing. Relatively after the Batman encounter you can walk threw \"The Batman Experience\" its basically a walkthrough \nthrew all the iconic moments from the Arkham games and oh man did they give me a nostalgic kickback. all the cool characters, all the cool scenes and memories about the games.\nIt seems almost like Suicide Squads wants to mock you and tell you \"this game will never be as good as those games...\".\n\nSo in the end, although I enjoyed some of the cutscenes, the gameplay loop killed it for me. It just wasn't fun compared to their previous games. I was looking for a nice story, cool combat, cool traversal systems. \n\nIn the story sequences you get a hint that Rocksteady is still able to create and inscenate great story moments, but they gave it away to create a dull and stupid service game. \n\nI rarely leave a thumbs down review, but in this case I had no choice. Refunded after 2 hours and it wasnt even worth the 19,99\u20ac I payed.\n\nI look on the bright side: hopefully this mess will be the reason that Rocksteady's next game goes back to the roots.",

The gameplay is decent and like everyone else has already said the traversal is very nice. I love the world that rocksteady has created and the character designs (excluding harley) are all incredible, with the facial expressions being probably the best ever in any game. The story isn't that bad, or should I say it isn't as bad as some say, but you can definitely feel they are pushing an agenda. Now onto the biggest problems. A bit after beating the flash boss fight I came across a part of the game where you have to beat a bunch of small side quests for some characters. That's where I got stuck and couldn't progress. Specifically on the missions that you had to hunt down data teminauts the indicator at the corner of the screen most of the time just wouldn't show up so I would wander around aimlessly. I'm not sure if it's intentional and the indicator will only show up when you're close to one but that seems insane. Now, when I try to play the season 2 episodes, I get stuck on the loading screen and literally can't play the game that I paid for. If the technical issues didn't happen, it would be a 7, but now it's really like a 4.5, or just below a 5. I would've recommended you to buy it on sale if there weren't technical problems, but sadly there are.",

I haven\u2019t had any performance issues (I\u2019m running a 3060 and a Ryzen 5 3600, so not exactly top-of-the-line), though I understand some players have.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a decent game, and I believe it received a lot of undeserved hate. It saddens me to think it might be shutting down sooner rather than later, because the game has a lot of potential. If you want to try it and can get it for cheap, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it!",

This game had crazy amounts of potential but I have no idea why all of that was pushed aside for, as one example, the sake of trying to artificially inflate play count by forcing them to grind.\n\nNevertheless, I'd only recommend this if it's on sale as there's definitely fun to be had with the characters and cutscenes.

        "review": "I did not think this game was going to be as bad as I've heard, but it was. Where do I even begin? First off, there are a couple of positives. The traversal around the map is actually a lot of fun. They gave each character a skill to allow they to move effectively, and they're all very engaging. The only other positive I have about this game is the Batman sections. They are excellent, in no doubt thanks to Kevin Conroy (Rest in peace) and the character building from the Arkham series. Now the negatives. The combat variety is basically non existent. They will throw new enemies at you throughout the campaign, but most of them are similar enemies with new mechanics designed to artificially inflate their health. The strategy of melee, shoot, and then special normally kills just about everything. The missions are extremely repetitive apart from the Justice League portion of the campaign. It's all just generic \"Go here and survive this long\", or \"Kill this many guys before the time limit\" over and over again. The weapon variety is also lacking. All guns feel like they do the same thing. I won't even get into the negatives with the story, because they've been covered by better reviewers, but the one thing that I have to mention is that Rocksteady didn't even have the dignity to stick to their decision. As of one of the recent updates, they pulled a reverse and basically made the Justice League not be dead. You know, the whole plot of this game? It was all for nothing. They knew they were going to lose money by killing off the characters, so they're already back. TLDR, this game is absolutely terrible. Don't buy it.",

Where the game truly collapses is the fact that the entire game (including it's singleplayer content) is hosted on a server. Meaning if the connection is bad, there goes all of your save data. At any point your game can just go offline. It happened to me tonight. Under no circumstances should this primarily singleplayer game be built like this.

        "review": "RECOMMEND IF ON SALE:\nSome of the graphics are crap because whoever did the shadow work sucks at their job....all the other art is fine, but the shadows are jumpy and ugly.   The mechanics are a bit bumpy and clumsy, but once you get used to using your character's skills, it is SO MUCH fun!  The graphics and the mechanics are definitely things, but the bigger thing for me is how FUN it is to play.  I love these characters and the story line.  I've always been a bigger fan of the DC villains than the heros so regardless of the flaws, the story line and the characters will keep me coming back.  It would be nice to have friends who play, but at the same time, I'm awful at shooters, so prefer to play alone.  Despite what other reviews say, the writing is punchy and funny.  The voice work is perfect.  Deadshot takes after Franklin from GTA V but for me, that's  a good thing, Franklin's my boy.  I will say there are a lot of cut scenes, but you can't miss them or you won't know your objective.  As far as I can tell there's no way to play them back either.  The game play between cut scenes/objectives isn't long enough.  I'm still gonna play the CRAP out of this game...when I can get it to LOAD.  I do have to stop and start again at least twice. But I had to do that with Arkham Knight too, and no....it's not my internet speed, or my refresh rate.  It is pretty glitchy too, but I guess it depends on what you 're looking for and how much you're willing to spend for a game.  I purchased this from Steam for $14 but I never would've paid $60.",

        "review": "This is one of those moments where Valve really needs to add a neutral option to their reviews.\n\nThe game for what it's worth is quite fun, but definitely not worth full price. I purchased it on an 80% sale @ $14 and this is WELL worth a $14 game.\n\nThe combat is fast paced, yet slightly janky... it's a dumbed down melee brawler derived from the Arkham series to allow for better designed and satisfying ranged combat. Traversal is reminiscent of Gotham Knights less the horrendous vehicle physics, the use of vehicles in this game are more polished and responsive.\n\nMetropolis is a beautifly designed city although you only effectively use a portion of it in game, giving a 1930/40's vibe as a tribute to the age DC comics originally came up with their heroes and also has a somewhat futuristic and multi-layered design.\n\nThe boss fights pose a challenge and have a much grander feel to fighting the front-line forces, however, it still doesn't feel like you're actually taking on the Justice League, more so their nerfed counter parts. (Except for Green Lantern early on because of well, plot armour)\n\nThe voice acting is well done and the story takes on a reasonable pace that keeps up with your level progression.\n\nMy positives for the game:\n\n1. Fast-paced gameplay that requires variety, yet does become tedious with all the mechanics involved.\n2. Beautifully crafted city with limitless traversal\n3. A wide selection of weapons and equipables to cater to one's preferred playstyle\n4. The story of 4 miscreants with 0 chemistry being constantly back-stabbed is fitting, although some characters are just too much\n5. Somewhat quick linear progression where the game tends to throw everything at you within the first few hours. Some people may not enjoy this.\n6. There is a wide variety of missions that revolve around 3-4 basic tropes that you would find in a game like this that do throw different varieties of enemies at you to keep you on your toes.\n\nHowever, there are some caveats:\n\n1. Captain Boomerang is annoying AF, I understand that it is his character, but, they could've toned this down just a bit\n2. Deadshot is a whiny Karen, also could have been toned down\n3. The skill trees don't allow for true character customisation as they should as you earn points that alternate between trees as you level up. You also only get a single perk to choose from at times which doesn't really give you that RPG feel that they were going for. However, some choices, when you do get them make drastic enough changes to your character. \n5. Combat has a myriad of mechanics involved and can be a bit wonky at times\n\nOther than that, I was never expecting another game tied in to the Arkham lore, and Rocksteady did put monumental effort into making a fresh, new IP (and i feel that they were successful in doing so, yet the game itself was not well received), so, I'm not as butt-hurt as the majority of the fan base, nor am I too particularly happy about it being a live service game, but it is what it is.\n\nAll-in-all this is a genuine 7/10 game if you're going to focus on getting through the story. I would recommend picking it up between $10 - S20",

I didn't mind that but I see a lot of reviews bashing it because of it, it's no where near as repetitive as other games I've played (2013 Deadpool game I'm pointing at specifically). Movement is fun but if one character doesn't click it's horrible trying to play as them (King Shark was my most anticipated character to play and I ended up with Captain Boomerang purely for movement in the beginning).

Clearly this was the misguided foundation of the game, and despite traversal being fun and sometimes satisfying, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short.\n\nYou will find negative reviews that call the game's choices for different characters \"woke\" or the like. These trolls are just classic morons and bigots -- the game is trash because the gameplay is hollow, not really the characters. The plot is also weak, but could have been ok if the seasonal content had more development and the bosses weren't so undeveloped and unfun.",

There was a few glitches such as sometimes the mission was bugged or something wasn't working or showing up so you would have to restart the session and that was kinda annoying. \nNow, for what really threw me was the DLC. I did not like the way they did this at all. Once you finish the story and you get into the DLC, you start from level one again on that Episode. Meaning you must grind out missions to get to level 35 in order to do anymore of the \"story\" for that episode. It's not fast, you have to grind and spam things you've already done and that is not fun. You have to do this for EVERY episode that's come out. That's a killer for me, I don't want to just spam the same thing over and over again to level. \n\nOverall: 6.5/10 \nBought it for less than 15$ with the DLC and it was worth that price so overall I'm not complaining.",

In my opinion Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is just not worth it at those prices.\n\nWould only recommend the game if it can be had for $20 dollars or lower.\n\n\nWhile I do enjoy the game in a way and do enjoy the banter between the chars when playing. I just value the game no more than $20 dollars at most.\n\nAs for gameplay problems I really only noticed couple things. First one being once in a while during a cutscene the voices to lips will not be in sync. Sample while Shark is talking you will hear Harley's voice. While other people might get mad about that happening I find it sorta funny.\n\nAlso once in a while I noticed the game will freeze like the game locked up. I noticed it would stay like that for maybe around 5 seconds never really timed it though. At which point the game will go back to normal.\n\nWhile I am running an older system running an i7 9700K and RTX 2060 12GB video card. I really don't believe it's my PC causing the game to freeze now and then. Cause I can play any of my other games just fine.\n\nBesides the two problems I listed above I do find the game fun. Plus the fact I got the game for the price I paid for it.",

Performance is good too if you have a solid pc.\n\nStory so far is pretty good too like wtf are people crying about? I already know the spoiler [spoiler] that Batman dies [/spoiler] but cmon thats something good. Next game your loved superhero is alive again who the f*ck cares. At least we could see something new and not that happy ending \"every superhero survives\" like always crap.\n\nI don`t say this is the best game of the year or anything else I already can see it`s flaws compared to the arkham series but like I said for the 80% off sale it`s pretty solid.",

At first, I was hesitant to try it out because of the overwhelming negative reviews I\u2019d seen, but I didn\u2019t want anyone else to miss out on something amazing due to that, so here I am sharing my honest experience.\n\nAs a huge fan of the Arkham Batman series (they were masterpieces to me in my teenage years, a perfect blend of art and gameplay), it was tough to come to terms with what happens to Batman in this game. But at the same time, it\u2019s fascinating to see how our beloved heroes could be portrayed in their darkest moments.\n\nFor me, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League feels like a fresh breath of air, especially after Gotham Knights. It's incredibly exciting to step into the shoes of Deadshot and other antiheroes and villains. The gameplay mission with Mrs. Freeze from Season 2 that I watched blew my mind\u2014it\u2019s absolutely stunning!\n\nBut on the other hand, the game suffers from poor optimization and performance issues, especially on lower-end devices like the Steam Deck. This really hampers the gaming experience, making it difficult to fully enjoy the game. I hope Rocksteady can address these issues in future patches, as it\u2019s a shame that such a great game is held back by technical problems.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying the storyline, which is genuinely engaging, and I can\u2019t wait for new seasons and characters! The gameplay is so varied; you really need to experience it for yourself.\n\nA huge thank you to Rocksteady Studios for delivering this masterpiece despite the performance issues! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udca5",

        "review": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is one of those games that, unfortunately, got swept into the vortex of modern gaming woes. Yes, it launched with bugs, and yes, the internet quickly latched onto those issues. However, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that bugs are a common, frustrating reality in gaming today. Many recent titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 or Fallout 76, were trainwrecks at launch but improved significantly with updates. Suicide Squad isn\u2019t exempt from this unfortunate trend, but it also follows the pattern of getting better over time.\n\nIn terms of the superhero genre, the pickings are slim right now. With DC Universe Online effectively dead, City of Heroes clinging to life on private servers, and Champions Online practically irrelevant, Suicide Squad stands out as one of the few superhero multiplayer experiences we have left. And honestly? It\u2019s fun. Is it repetitive at times? Yes. Is it terrible? No. There\u2019s solid enjoyment to be had, even if the game could benefit from some fresh ideas, additional enemy types, and perhaps more variety in the factions\u2014just like its Arkham predecessors.\n\nThe plot is another redeeming factor, especially for long-time DC fans. At first glance, the story seems straightforward, but as the narrative unfolds, it hints at a larger multiverse plot involving Brainiac\u2019s invasion. Without spoiling too much, this twist injects excitement and speculation into the game, suggesting that maybe the Justice League you\u2019re up against isn\u2019t even from your universe. It\u2019s a classic DC move, diving into the multiverse concept, and it opens up some intriguing possibilities for future DLCs.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a small percentage of players have actually spent meaningful time with the game, as evidenced by achievement statistics on Steam. So, before writing it off based on early criticism, give it a try\u2014you might enjoy it more than you think.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, as a long-time DC fan, I was skeptical at first. The game didn\u2019t truly click for me until the Flash boss battle. But from that point forward, it became fun and engaging, especially with the speculation around the plot.\n\nIn short, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is an enjoyable superhero romp. It may not revolutionize the genre, but it\u2019s a solid experience with fun combat, well-written humor, and characters that feel true to their personalities. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s far from the disaster some are making it out to be. If you give it a fair shot, you might be surprised by how much fun you have.",

        "review": "For a start, I'd say the game is genuinely fun, with unique mechanics and styles to each squad member. The feedback regarding the use of guns tend to be silly, since a melee build is still highly plausible to play around should you choose to make use of it. I may not agree that they should've gone that route, but it's still entertaining to play with. If you're a fan of the suicide squad characters and comics in general, the game is enjoyable and you're likely to have a good time just watching the characters and squad dynamics throughout the main campaign and the occasional banter / commentary in the overworld. The audio file collectibles can be tedious however, tho it's similar enough to collecting Riddler trophies in the arkham games that you don't think too much about it and just do it. \n\nThe main thing that bogs it down is its repetitive live-service elements. The story is taking an interesting direction in the latest episode (as of this review it's ep4), and I feel like the game genuinely would've fared better if they just gave us a proper solo story campaign from the get-go - with the inclusion of where the story seems to be heading. The campaign we were given at launch ends with pretty much a \"huh? that'ts it?\" beat. The potential is there, but the chopping up of story acts to drop during live-service episodes just hurts the interest in the game, esp when the live-service elements are repetitive incursion missions that don't retain much interest from fans who don't care for more guns. The Arkham games were spectacular and replayable because the story and beats were packaged so neatly, I just wish Rocksteady and WB games did the same for this. \n\nAll in all I personally still play the game because I still hope to see where the story leads (that IS the main appeal to me), and as a Suicide Squad fan myself I just enjoy getting to see the squad in a game. It's a shame that higher ups chose to make this a live-service, as I'm almost certain the negative feedback wouldn't be as severe if it was a solid story-driven campaign. Love the characters, enjoy the potential, don't enjoy the repetitiveness and waits for live-service updates for story. Will still recommend the game, but not at the price it's at. For fans of the squad, I'd suggest waiting for a good sale to try it out.",

        "review": "It's alright, don't buy this for the full price tag though, I got the deluxe for 28 and still have the DLC else world stuff to explore and I've got almost 50 hours in. So I'd say its worth it, if you just wanted standard edition there is one that is 18 dollars on gg deals. Not a bad price considering how we should be getting the third season of content relatively soon, hoping its decent though since they just started doing lay offs at the company, so really its not the greatest game but not that bad either. Don't come into this thinking its anything like Arkham knight or city / asylum. Its not, it uses the existing lore established from those games with some cool little easter eggs here and there plus riddler is in it, so ya know you got that mechanic returning lol. Overall though I was quite satisfied with the game although the end game definitely can get repetitive I did like the story parts and a few other things too. They did kill my boy Kevin but I do believe if the multiverse facet is a part of the endgame which it is, than flash could legit just flash point the arkham verse making the suicide squad from never happening. Shit they could make origins the new cannon which is seemingly what is happening with Arkham Shadows ? Not a bad idea at all since I liked origins for what it was. Good game overall 7/10 wish there was more end game content. Will change to 8/10 if they do successfully add in the last 13 Spoilers here - Brainiac's into end game which is essentially another planet for you to kill brainiac on and add the true game ending if that's even possible at this point.\n\nSIDE Note / EDIT: Really should be changing my review to a negative but I will keep it because I did enjoy the base game content. HUGE WARNING if you wanted to experience the Joker World and Also Mr's Freeze episodes in order you are simply fucked or screwed over since I can't curse. It is simply impossible to go back to episode one after beating the game. It force jumps you alllll the way to episode 4. So Brainiac is talking about how Mrs Freeze helped rescue the ----Big Spoiler---- but not like it matters since you cant go back and enjoy everything for yourself. The Flash. How the fuck did that happen how did we find another flash let alone is he infected or is he normal? You don't know because you can't properly experience the story yourself. I was seriously blown away by this design choice/decision, huge letdown to not simply let you load into the Elseworlds that you want to load into like the Joker World that looks different from the base game metropolis. First, the water is changed, the sky box is changed, the textures and buildings are changed, and new exterior buildings are added in the Joker world! All of this content is now locked away forever! Oh but don't worry episode 4 you get a couple of really \"cool\" ice Spikes. Thats it.... No new buildings, skybox, water color, Christ it doesn't even fucking snow at the very least. You'd think if you're adding in Mr Freeze (Mrs.Freeze) You'd at least have a snowing weather type to make it feel colder since you know he needs cold to stay alive. However though I guess the team got fired well into making season 2 of Mrs.Freeze because man, what a letdown in both terms of character and Map, the map is not different at all no one can convince me it is, they only changed the areas that brainiac spawns things in hence the giant ice spike in the ground, not cool or interesting at all like Jokers Worlds was. Will be waiting patiently to see if Rocksteady jumped ahead of this garbage season and added cool things to Season 3's Gotham-themed Metropolis. It is the only explanation as to why this season is so fucking empty and lifeless. compared to season 1 which wasn't great either but in terms of the Map yeah, it was 10 times better.",
