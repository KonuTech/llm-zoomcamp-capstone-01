I think that Ubisoft with it know-how on world building could do some amazing stuff, but almost every game it puts the quantity value above quality. I would love to see the % of people that actually finish their games. Assassin's Creed Valhalla, as well as most Ubisoft games are good if you buy them on a ~ 50% discount. Then their games are worth it and you will have a good time knowing that those hours you put into their games did not cost you any absurd amount of money, just absurd amount of time before putting it on a \"unfinished\" shelve.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Avoid\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2705 Wait for a discount\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\ud83d\udd32 Buy it now\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800",

        "review": "After putting in the same amount of hours that i needed to 100% finish Odyssey here I am finishing 100% of Valhalla. It was a nice adventure with a lot of fun and cool quests and locations.\n\n[h1] The good [/h1]\n\nThey really nailed the viking experience I felt watching the Vikings tv show from 2013. Even tho it felt like a mini game the whole raiding settlements and monasteries I did enjoy it a lot, but kinda wished they did more with it.\n\nThe story was ok and I really liked what they did with the whole reincarnation of the 'old gods'. The story could have been better presented or at least give some weight to the alliances you get over the time of playing. After finishing a zone and you get that alliances you might never get a chance to ever go back and you will only see 1 or 2 characters from that zone in conquests to just kick the bucket or tell you they won't help you in the future. This was missed potential and I wished they implemented the story better and not feel like it's a episodic tv show.\n\nI liked the items in this game, especially dual wielding axes. It wake up the viking in me. What I didn't like was how spread out the weapons were and for most of the game you were either forced to ignore the story to hunt down map for weapons/armor sets or just play with whatever you have on you.\n\n\n[h1] The bad [/h1]\n\nThe combat was so boring, most of the time I just spammed left click without event trying to dodge because I had dual spears which is the best build you can make without even caring what spears they are. I wish they didn't make the enemies to annoying to fight with the rest of the weapons, but here we are.\n\nI can understand Origins and Odyssey for the lack of actual assassins, but what is the excuse here? Just because Eivor thinks they are stupid we aren't actually an assassin and just go about the country side murdering members of the cult with no personal goal.\n\nEven tho I liked to play as Odin and go about my business in the god's land I hated every minute of this. It was so badly implemented and I was surprised when they didn't make just one dlc they made TWO that were a continuation of the story.\n\n\n[h1] The Legend of Beowulf [/h1]\n\nShort, boring and uninteresting. They could have made this so much more interesting just by the fact of implementing something like they did with the olympus monsters in Odyssey.\n\n\n[h1] Wrath of the Druids [/h1]\n\nI liked the fact that I got o visit Ireland, but I hated the story line with the cliche getting back stabbed by the so called close friend in the end.\n\n\n[h1] The Siege of Paris [/h1]\n\nThe story felt like it was forced just to make us visit France. The fact that we were the only person that can fix their problems is mind boggling. We weren't even on the same piece of land and had to cross the ocean to get there to help the people with their problems.\n\n\n[h1] Dawn of Ragnar\u00f6k [/h1]\n\nI hated every minute of this garbage.\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\n\nEven tho I hated the dlcs and how they implemented the story sections in the base game I did have fun playing as a viking and would recommend this game to anybody who has seen any viking piece of media. Get this game on a sale since it often goes on 75-80% sales.",

        "review": "Coming from a lifelong fan of the Assassin's Creed games, I have to say that AC Valhalla is quite a different direction that the franchise has taken. But is that really a bad thing?\r\n\r\nVeering off the long-beaten path, Valhalla presents an absolutely massive open-world map with breathtaking landscapes, and even additional realms of travel beyond the base-game's area (various trips to additional nations, locations, etc). This is quite a stark change from the founding games, and one that has been progressively added to since AC Origins. Another stark difference of Valhalla is the divorce between the traditional combat and stealth we've always known. No longer are the days where stealth is a requirement for an Assassin's Creed game. Now, you are a brute of a viking with a big, heavy ax, and subtlety is not exactly your strong suit. \r\n\r\nThese two major changes were enough to scare off many AC traditionalist, but to put it frankly? The tradition AC format was getting old. How many times can you creep through a building and stalk rooftops to pounce on some dude until you get bored. For me, it was 15 years. I, for one, love the chance that has been made (so far) and look forward to the new face of the Assassin's Creed. Lets hope they don't f*** it up.",

It has proved to be a very fun game for me and a very enjoyable and interesting story to experience! I absolutely love the work put into the Norse details, architecture, clothing, voices, etc. it really does a lot to bring you into the world! The variation of difficulties is appreciated, so whether I wanna unwind after work and enjoy the story with manageable combat or if I really wanna duke it out in a challenge, I've got options! I also really enjoy the open world, as someone who loves games such as Skyrim, Witcher III, and Tears of the Kingdom I find myself enjoying this game's open world and all the mystery, story, and such that its been populated with!!",

        "review": "I finally did it. I completed the worst Assassins' Creed game. Fully, with all DLCs and their collectibles.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this game. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. Well, you can, but... Compared to the previous few entries - this game overstays its welcome for more than 150 hours.\n\nI think maybe the first 50h or so are decent. You experience new things like raiding, a bit different combat, new characters, areas and locations. And then you hit a brick wall of repetitiveness, wokeness, very mediocre writing, constant stupid puzzles plastered all over the world. It just sucks the fun out of the game and out of you. This game becomes like a job you despise.\n\nThere are a lot to talk about this game, but I'll just throw some random thoughts about it. \n\nSo.\n\nOnce you get to England after tutorial in Norway, you get that big map with many different areas to conquer. You can only choose to do 1 out of 2 or 3 at a time, It's all good and dandy. You go to new area, go to the leader, help him to become the king or whatever of that land and be done with it. You have to do that more like 10 times or so. Every area has it's own story and mostly its own characters. You forge new alliances, it's cool. It's like you are preparing for the one big battle at the end. At least I though so, but the very end of the story is so badly written, so badly done, so disappointing that everything you did felt so F pointless at the very end. And the story just ends. Ha. What a f. Terrible. Most region stories are very forgettable and with 0 intrigue. Most cities are the same. Basically mud and wooden houses everywhere. Only Jorvik was a fun city to explore and memorable.\n\nI only liked Ivarr as a character. He was the only one that was unpredictable, had charisma, good lines and was genuinely funny. This game lacks funny moments/dialogues. Everything feels very \"by the numbers\" from start to finish. The main character, Eivor, is just as bland as blank page. He (I played as male, like a true viking) lacks charisma. He feels shallow. Not interesting. Even though he talks and talks and talks, but in the end - it's just like a fart in the wind. Even Sigurd, who is just an annoying c*nt, has more personality than Eivor. If Eivor was like Ivarr... Imagine 200h of Trevor from GTA 5. This game would have been such a f*kng hit and a cult classic for the ages. But nah. What we got is a sterile character without any personality.\n\nItemisation in this game is terrible. I didn't even need to change my armor set... not even once from start to finish. Every item and their bonuses are so meh that I didn't even bother. The same can be said about weapons. You find what you like and stick with it till the end of the game. You can max out all the skill tree. It takes some time, but what's the point of having a skill tree with small passives if you can get everything?... At least AC: Odyssey had a simpler skill tree which achieved the exact same thing in the end, and it was much less annoying to unlock skills.\n\nPower level is also whatever, there is no difference in damage done if you are power level 200 or 400. All the combat feels exactly the same throughout the whole game (damage-wise), maybe only your damage reduction gets better the more passives you unlock. At least that's how it felt to me.\n\nThen there is that mysterious order and their members.. ooo... spoooky.... But nah. You only encounter like 2-3 of them in the main storyline and all the other ones (like 30+ of them) are just random NPCs you kill if you find their clues. That's it. Hunting the order members sounds really cool, but the way it's done is just abysmall. It was just slapped like a s*it on a wall and left hanging without any meaningful purpose.\n\nAnd my biggest gripe with this game - various challenges (collecting flying tattoo papers (0 fun),\nmysteries (extremely short side quests that can be done in 30 seconds most of the time - 0 fun), \n10 anomalies - (unending climbing puzzles that overstays its welcome as soon as you encounter them), \nHallucinogenic mushrooms and its puzzles - (2/10 fun). \nBig statues with offerings where you have to bring certain amount of certain items - 0 fun if you have to find a rare fish and get like 5 of them. \nCairns... there are a lot of them and 3 of them are probably the most annoying thing I've ever done in gaming... if you want to complete them all - prepare to rotate the freaking stones for 1 hour straight... Holy sh*t... -10 fun. \n\nWhat I liked was drinking games and I really liked Orlog mini game with 6 dices. Always enjoyed doing those. \n\nAnd finally chests.... billions of chests... chest underground, chest that require keys scattered all over the place, chests that are behind barred doors... So muuch fun going around houses like 5 times just to spot a teeny tiny hole to shoot an arrow from/through or get inside into the house though a destroyable unnoticeable hole. And you have to do that hundreds of times if you want to open them all. And I did. And I can't imagine myself replaying this game, because of how stupid every single little thing is in this game. \nOooh. Yes. I forgot. \nRaiding with stupidly slow friendly NPCs that always get stuck somewhere and you have to wait for them to come to you in order to open a big chest or a massive door... So fun. Great coding. And you'll have to raid like 50 places. So yeah. Not repetitive at all.\n\nAnd finally - crashes. Lots of crashes. It crashes no matter what. Every 1-2 hours (sometimes every 5-10 minutes), every monday, every friday, every single day. It just crashes. And then you have to launch the game and wait for a billion seconds before the game loads and you can finally go and do the exact same thing for one hundred and first time. Ahh. Such a blessing of a game.\n\nBut I liked the combat.",

It feels like development needed someone to say \"no,\" and edit things down to just the good bits.\n*  In 2024, it's still buggy.  I've had a crash-to-desktop every five hours or so.  There were cut-scenes with missing people holding torches floating in mid-air.  The NPC AI glitches out sometimes, leading to stuck characters, even during escort quests.\n*  Many of the landmarks on the map are duplicates of the same models, which somewhat ruins the illusion of the huge open world.  I've seen the same ruined tower half a dozen time and the same longhouse at least as often.\n*  The \"Path of Exile\"-style gigantic skill-tree is tedious and unnecessary.\n*  The sci-fi and modern world story elements are ridiculous, uninteresting and diminish my engagement with the narrative.  I wish they would remove them from future AC games.\n*  Many of the mini side quests are overly silly in tone and feel trivial.\n\nI'm giving it a \"not recommended\" generally, but if you are particularly a fan of the setting or AC games in general, then you might be able to overlook the flaws and enjoy it.\n",

        "review": "I have very mixed feelings about this game. The viking setting feels okay, clothes, weapons, scenes are good. Villages, towns, feels lively. Graphics are good. \n[h2]GAMEPLAY:[/h2] At first, raids feel... raidish, and later they feel rubbish. Learned fast that raids are seriously about running in, getting the 1-4 big treasure box, then leaving. If you don't die, you will always succeed. Big sieges are even worse in this, you just have to rush to objectives, then everyone will advance. You can literally fight forever if you don't go objective, enemy spawns out of nowhere constantly. Oh and when you advance, suddenly your teammates are already fighting in the area, which was inaccesible by them a few seconds ago :D Abilities are unlockable, but you can win the game without them (I only used 2 frequently, but just to advance faster).  Skills matter until you reach around power level 140, you just have to learn to parry and dodge, some skills boost them, if you learn those you can beat enemies with 100-200 level higher then yours. Items can be found, they add buffs, but not much, and not worth the effort. I finished the game with upgrading the basic raven clan set, and 2 axes I got at the begining of the game.\n[h2]STORY:[/h2] I can say the story is just as fluctuating between bad and good, as the gameplay. The real world story is close to non-existing. It continues the ac3-odussey storyline, but you will only know 2 times that a world exists outside animus. [spoiler]And the second time is the end of the game, where our protagonist mind stuck in the \"cloud\" forever, and the antagonist gets out unharmed, and takes over her role, and you do the end story and dlc-s with him playing as Eivor. And noone cares about him, they just: okay. In the end we did not solve the main plot, did not save the world, literally the whole 100 hour search is pointless, because the good guys just remember that in AC3 Desmond saved the world, and because of him, the machine is still turned on. Also, the super advanced civilization, which can upload their minds to a virtual world, create a magnetic field around a globe, create a mind connected global WIFI, download copy of their mind to anyone, can't solve the problems of the sun shooting SOLAR FLARES. Excuse me, but what kind of bullshit is this? [/spoiler] Eivor story is also a bit messy, his/her personality switches randomly, which can be okay, because of the main plot, but his/hers gender does that too, even if you fix it to one, there are parts where he just suddenly becomes she for a cutscene, or just the beard dissapeares :D In terms of morals, it's very twisted, It's hard to justify the things we do. I mean, how can we be the good guys, while we rob every military building and monastery in England? Also I find it funny that you can only kill soldiers, and order member, if you start killing civilans, the animus well desync. Didn't know vikings were such nice people. Side quests (world events) only good to boost exp and power level, but doesn't add much, some are fun, but will get tired of other activities fast. Pledging territories have the same quest structure: go there, talk some, go talk at some other place, get attacked, talk at another place, oh evil somewhere, free some people or get something, get back, assault a fort or monastery, we are friends now. The bigger assaults just doesn't feel bigger, because there won't be more soldiers, just your allies as unique soldiers, but they do as much as common footsoldiers, fighting in the background with not doing anything else. It's just feels like a low budget historical documentary. You can only loose them if the story has in it. The Order of the ancients (later in time templars) are a bunch of burnt out common folks, you won't even meet most of them, just when you found enough clues, they have close to 0 impact on the world, it's like ubisoft didn't have the time to add them to the world properly. [spoiler] At the end, when you find out that Aelfred was the leader, Eivor just does nothing. Before that, we just killed people without question, In the end we beleive Aelfred that he hates the order and just INHERITED the leadership from his brother. Gives Eivor the medal, and Eivor is okay with it, just walks back home with the work is done. I know that Aelfred created the templars, therefore he had to survive, but this is just poor writing and a pointless ending. [/spoiler] Some of them at least has proper story, i would think that the 5 most important ones, but not :D Sigurds part in the story, and his character developement is shallow too, he is just there, doesn't do much while Eivor does everything, then gets mad for a while, then he gets well. In the begining and in the end he has crucial part, other than that, he is just a guy traveling around having a god complex. [spoiler]Basims character just doesn't add up. He is with the assasins, killing order members, but his main goal is to kill all asgardians reincarnation. Somehow he has all his memories, while asgardians not. Basim is against the order, but their methods are more likely connected to Loki, than anything else. If the leader of the order would have been Basim, this part would have make sense, because that way he would have pulled out a double twist, and trick every party. Also he never killed, revealed, took part of killing order members. He knew Fulke was obsessed with the old gods, and have methods to awaken asgardian reincarnations, he drove Sigurd to Fulke.  [/spoiler]\n\nIn overal the game is okay as a viking game, for an AC game it's not really. Characters mostly blunt, plot is weak, story is pointless many parts. Fun to play for a time, but it gets boring after a few territory pledge, and some quests are annoyingly slow. Get in when the price is lower.",

I thought the Egyptian and Greek assassin's creeds were bloated, this one take the cake. There is so much pointlessly fetch questing, fighting nameless enemies, and the assassinations mean entirely nothing. \n\nThe narrative ends with the leader of the order telling you that he was the one that left you all the clues to kill everyone else in his group. He then just walks away and tell you to trust that he won't do anything else anymore. Also, you could put a gun to my head and I wouldn't be able to name any major characters in the game since they're all just bit characters.\n\nTo give you an example of the pointlessness of some parts of the game. The river raiding segment of the game gives you resources that only upgrade the river raiding, which in turn lets you do more river raiding. Its a Sisyphean cycle of pointless grinding so that you can grind some more. I got the settlement to max level, its upgrades are pointless and meaningless, the power increase they give you is about as much as a few levels.\n\nI beat the main game, the Ireland DLC, the Ragnorok DLC and got a fair way through the France DLC.\n\nThe only part of any of these games that was mildly entertaining was the assassinations within the French DLC that actually had you making an event of the assassination.\n\nAbsolute waste of time, I'm going to reinstall BG3 now that patch seven is out and actually play something that is fun.",

It is no longer a game studio but a circus that wants to show people that regardless of how useless and incompetent you are, you can still become a developer at a triple a studio just by having a skin color that is different than white or a gender that is not male.

The game itself is quite enjoyable, but I can only play it in roughly 30 - 60 min intervals before it either crashes to desktop, locks the computer up completely, or randomly reboots it.

Mess with the ram allocation, update video card/game/windows, reinstall, turned off online mode, disabled cloud saves, attempt to run in compatibility mode, reducing graphics, verified time and date on PC is in sync, turned off all background programs, uninstalled a few that some said could affect it (afterburner), verified I have a system that can run it and not a potato (32G of ram, RTX2060Super, i7 10th gen), verified the integrity of the game in Steam, prayed to god, jesus, and anyone else that would listen) and the piece of crap game still crashes and is the only game that does. I have over 100 hours in Odysssey and it might have done it once or twice total.

        "review": "The core experience is a good game, and based on that alone I would recommend it if you like the viking theme - it is a gorgeous realization of those lands at that time.  \n\nHowever its worth is severely undermined by the ubiquitous presence of microtransactions, turning playing the game into a manipulation and ad-infested mixed experience.  I don't mind Ubisoft putting money into extra stuff that is available for people who want to spend extra money, but it should not interfere with the core experience, and this absolutely does - enormously.  \n\nConcretely, there is an alternative to the premium currency that can be collected in minuscule amounts in the game world, and used to buy random premium items from a rotating store, which could be seen as a kindness.  However, more truly, it is a manipulative strategy designed this way to make players pay attention to and want microtransaction items, and ingrain a twisted value for the premium currency defined by the time you spend trying to gather enough of the other currency, and the rotating store makes it so by the time you have the money for what you want, you likely won't actually see it or be able to buy it anyway.  It is an intentionally designed system to manipulate players to spend more money.  And again, this system is impossible to ignore, with in-game quests, and incessant advertisements on pause screens, and more.  \n\nI'll also add, though it is a lesser concern, that the items themselves are tiers above in grandeur and \"power\" than what is available in the base game, so owning and even constantly seeing the items once again undermines the core experience, making the allure of seeking greater and more powerful rewards not so meaningful, when the best rewards are earned with a credit card.  It all serves to make me feel less that I am immersing myself in a beautiful game, and more that I am trying to focus on that game, but it is being perverted into a system of manipulation to squeeze the maximum money out of me as they can.\n\nOverall, I think the people who made the core game mostly did a great job.  It could have used more progression to match the actual length of the game and its side content (enormous), and in my opinion the combat doesn't hold up against modern alternatives like FromSoft games and their like, but still the core game does a great job of realizing an immersive viking world, from northern lands to England to Ireland and beyond.  However, the oppressive atmosphere of player manipulation to spend more money actively undermines that core immersive formula.  Despite its faults I would gladly recommend it if those systems were not shoved down player throat so much, but as it is, I am playing the core game in-spite of their non-stop attempts to draw even more money out of us, despite paying for a full priced base game and multiple dlc.  \n\nThey had a beautifully crafted world, which could have used a bit more substance in some places, but still works great to draw me in, but then they added layers of malicious player manipulation on top to draw more money out of us, and I will never recommend such a system to other players.  I play a game like this to escape, or immerse myself into a world of imagination. Having the reality of endless corporate greed shoved into my face constantly, and having to resist and ignore their manipulative systems to enjoy the core game, is the opposite of what I want in my fantasy game.  I really hope Ubisoft does a major turnaround in how they handle their \"extra content\", stop trying to squeeze extra money out of us with manipulation while we try to play the base game, and unequivocally respect their players' right to just focus on the game we already paid for.",

However, the game's world still feels empty and monotonous. Not recommended for those of you who, like me, are easily bored when playing games. BUY WHEN THE PRICE IS DISCOUNTED AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET THAT YOU WASTED YOUR MONEY ON UBISOFT, (note) but I still recommend it for those of you who are curious but buy it when the price is discounted.",

        "review": "Ubisoft.\n\nValhalla is the last title of the Assassin's Creed franchise I will have played for potentially ever. I have enjoyed this franchise since the first game up to about Unity. I enjoyed Odyssey but that was mainly because of the setting. \n\nMy god is this game boring. Neither story nor gameplay were able to keep me entertained for more than an hour at a time and I don't even know where to start. It's. All. The. Same.\nI don't know who's idea it was to just scale open-world games bigger. Bigger does not equal better in most cases and this is a prime example. I am no longer 16 years old and I simply do not have the time to spend 2000 hours running through a barren wasteland trying to find thousands of artifacts. When I start a game, I want to be entertained. I want to have fun. And when I play this game, I feel like working. Mindlessly running around solving some random side quests that offer me literally no good reward, in a world that feels completely soulless and boring. But why not go for the main quest? Well, I couldn't even get myself to get past half of the main quests. It was just so exhausting. It's just the same and the same again, standard Ubisoft stuff. I do not understand why they keep using the same boring formula. \n\nSeeing that text in the trailer \"THE ULTIMATE ASSASSIN'S CREED EXPERIENCE\"... what? Do you guys even play your own games? What about this game is ASSASSIN'S CREED? Ahhh... the hidden blade... gg\n\n\"But there were real assassin's in the game\" :(\nCrazy. If that's enough for you to make this game earn it's place in this franchise then I know why they continue doing what they're doing.\n\nUbisoft will never change. They have committed to these soulless mass-produced \"AAA\" titles and I don't think anything can ever keep them from that path. Not even bankruptcy.\n\nThinking back to the memories I made with Black Flag... this just makes me cry.",

You'll have to find a very limited specific resource to do so and if it is a weapon you'll need to have multiple.\nWant to upgrade your settlement? You'll end up with a ton of supplies but basically no raw materials because of how limited they are and you can only really get raw materials from raiding monasteries which are limited per region.\nAnd the story isn't really even that interesting which makes the grind even rougher to get through.\nThe combat is also rarely ever fun and feels janky and unsatisfying.\nDoesn't help either that the game doesn't have Steam achievement support and also has a bug with Ubisoft Connect cloudsaves which causes it to crash after 15-20 minutes of gameplay which caused me to lose an entire raids worth of progress. (fixable by disabling cloud saving in ubisoft connect but still, its an issue that is 4 years old, how is this not fixed Ubisoft??)\n\nBuy on sale [b]only[/b] if you're really interested in the time period and/or if you want to continue the AC story after Odyssey.",

        "review": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the twelfth main installment in Ubisoft\u2019s renowned Assassin's Creed series. Set during the Viking Age, the game immerses players in the tumultuous era of Norse exploration and conquest. It follows Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider whose story intertwines with the broader conflicts of 9th-century England. With a sprawling open world, intricate lore, and rich character development, Valhalla is a grand entry that continues the series' tradition of blending historical fiction with engaging gameplay. The game\u2019s narrative is set in the late 800s, amidst the Viking invasions of England. Players assume the role of Eivor, who can be male or female, and lead their clan from Norway to England in search of a new home. The story is deeply rooted in Norse mythology and historical events, intertwining the Norse gods with the political and social upheaval of the time. The main storyline revolves around Eivor\u2019s quest to establish a Viking settlement in England while navigating the complex politics of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The narrative is enriched by detailed character arcs, including alliances with historical figures like King Alfred of Wessex and legendary Norse heroes. The game\u2019s story is divided into several acts, with major plot points involving epic battles, treacherous betrayals, and mystical elements tied to the Isu, an ancient civilization central to the series' lore.\n\nValhalla boasts a vast and diverse open world that captures the essence of Viking-era Britain. The game world is divided into several regions, each reflecting the distinct culture and geography of medieval England\u2014from the rolling hills of England\u2019s countryside to the frost-bitten landscapes of Norway. The open world is teeming with activities, from main quests and side missions to hidden collectibles and environmental puzzles. The game's exploration is bolstered by a well-designed fast-travel system, horseback riding, and a longship for navigating rivers and coastlines. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add realism and depth to the exploration experience. The combat system in Valhalla is robust and satisfying, offering a mix of brutal melee combat and strategic use of abilities. Players can engage in visceral, cinematic battles that involve a variety of weapons such as axes, swords, and bows. The dual-wielding system allows for a high degree of customization, letting players create their own combat style. The game also retains the series' stealth elements, although combat often takes precedence. Eivor can use stealth to approach enemies silently, perform assassinations, and utilize various tools such as smoke bombs and tranquilizer darts. The stealth mechanics are less central than in previous installments, focusing more on blending combat with tactical approach. Valhalla incorporates deep RPG mechanics, including a detailed skill tree, character progression, and customization options. Players earn skill points by completing quests and defeating enemies, which can be spent to unlock new abilities and improve Eivor\u2019s combat and exploration skills. The game also features a dialogue system that allows players to make choices influencing the narrative and relationships with other characters. The settlement-building feature is a key aspect of Valhalla. Players can upgrade and expand their Viking settlement, which provides various benefits such as new gear, resources, and gameplay enhancements. This system adds a layer of strategic depth and personal investment to the game. The game offers a wealth of quests and activities beyond the main storyline. Side quests range from solving local mysteries and assisting NPCs to engaging in mini-games and legendary hunts. Each activity is designed to enhance the immersive experience, providing additional lore and interaction opportunities. Visually, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is stunning, with detailed environments and character models that bring the Viking Age to life. The game\u2019s graphical fidelity is particularly impressive on next-gen consoles, offering rich textures, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects. The soundtrack complements the game\u2019s setting with a mix of traditional Norse music and orchestral scores. Voice acting is robust and adds emotional depth to the characters and narrative, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\n\nWhile Valhalla is a technical achievement, it is not without issues. Some players have reported bugs and performance hiccups, particularly on older hardware. However, Ubisoft has released several patches to address these concerns and improve the game\u2019s stability.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is a monumental addition to the series, offering a captivating Viking adventure that blends historical intrigue with mythological elements. Its expansive open world, engaging combat, and deep RPG mechanics provide a robust and immersive experience. Despite some technical issues and a less pronounced focus on stealth, the game\u2019s strengths make it a worthy journey for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise. For those intrigued by Norse mythology, medieval history, and expansive RPGs, Valhalla delivers an epic and satisfying experience that stands out as one of the series' most ambitious entries.\n\n",

I was happy to see that I could use my controller ... console gamer for a LONG time. I played the console version for several hours and completed the game but it felt a little flat.

Both the male and female leads are unremarkable , though the male is slightly better.\n\nAs for the story, the main plot is passable, but it feels repetitive. The characters are pretty forgettable, with only a few exceptions like Sigurd.\n\nThe side quests, however, are where the game truly lost me. The Niflheim segment, in particular, motivated me to write this review. Who thought this was a good idea? It\u2019s like a frustrating 'Hades' mode\u2014if you die, you start from scratch, buying upgrades and fighting bosses along the way. The worst part? You can't even quit unless you die, so after the first boss, I did just that. I honestly don't see the point.\n\nThe game mechanics remain largely unchanged, especially in terms of stealth and parkour.\nSometimes the climbing system gets stuck on small rocks or very short obstacles, forcing me to change direction just to get past. I usually give myself a few months between Assassin's Creed titles to avoid burnout. The combat, though, is solid and challenging\u2014the NPCs actually pose a threat, so there's a silver lining but overall the weapons are not great, I much prefer Origins weapons variety and upgrade mechanics, to be fair though the \"weakpoints\" mechanism when using the bow introduced in this title is a very solid addition to combat.\n\nThe good thing is that I bought this game on sale, otherwise, I\u2019d feel pretty bad.",

        "review": "This game is a dissapointment in everyway\n\nAs a long-time fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, I had high hopes for Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, but after spending countless hours in this game, I can't help but regret buying it. Ubisoft has turned what could have been a great Viking adventure into a drawn-out, bloated, and lifeless experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, the length of the game is absolutely unnecessary. Ubisoft has padded the game with an endless list of fetch quests, useless side missions, and tedious grinding that doesn't feel rewarding. Instead of focusing on meaningful content, Valhalla is stuffed with filler that only serves to artificially inflate the playtime. I\u2019m all for open-world exploration, but when 80% of the game feels like busywork, it\u2019s a problem.\n\nAnd then there's the story\u2014or lack thereof. Valhalla arguably has the worst story in the entire Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise. The narrative is disjointed, dull, and lacks any emotional depth. Eivor is a bland protagonist, and the Viking setting, which had so much potential, is squandered by uninspired writing. There\u2019s none of the intrigue or historical depth that made previous titles great. It feels like the Assassin\u2019s Creed identity has been lost in favor of trying to be a generic RPG.\n\nTo top it off, Ubisoft\u2019s downward trend continues. Year after year, they seem to care less about delivering quality and more about milking the franchise with microtransactions, repetitive content, and lifeless worlds. Valhalla is the perfect example of a game that prioritizes quantity over quality, and it shows.\n\nIn the end, I regret buying this game, and I can only hope Ubisoft listens to its fans before it\u2019s too late. Unfortunately, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is a game that has overstayed its welcome, and not in a good way.",

Odyssey was very polished and played great with no problems.  \n\nThis game is buggy and randomly crashes at times with no warning.  You will be playing normally, everything running fine, then it just closes with no message.  It also takes a lot longer to boot up, so it is not an easy thing to overlook.  I decided to end playing it in hopes that someday, Ubisoft will patch this and fix it.  Since it auto saves, when I came back in the game one time, my character spawned below the terrain and was stuck for several minutes.  That is a complete failure.  Many players have issues with this game crashing randomly.  It seems like a memory leak or something because it is related to the length of time playing it for the most part.  I don't know why so many people have the same problem, yet the publisher doesn't seem to care about patching it, there have been no updates to this game since they put it on Steam.  Right now, I can't recommend playing it, because you may get very annoyed when the game keeps shutting down randomly on you.  Maybe someday, but not now.",

I have also watched as that same company made one indefensible decision after another to sacrifice the player's experience in any way that makes them a quick buck. \n\nAn now as a result, even though there are amazing and truly talented programmers, writers and artists busting their asses to make new games that take the magic of Assassin's Creed to new, incredible heights...those experiences are locked behind layer after layer of paywalls, shitty optimisation and invasive (and often buggy) \"anti-cheat\" software. So even if you are someone like me who doesn't mind waiting the months and sometimes even years it takes for these games to be discounted to a price that is in any way reasonable...you will still find yourself spending many frustrating hours trying to get that game to work the way it is supposed to. And if you are anything like me you will often run out of patience before you breakthrough to the actual game-play, and just go play one of the hundreds of other amazing games out there that aren't being sold by people that hold such disdain for gamers.\n\nAll of which is to say, despite the fact that this is a beautiful game both in terms of game design and storytelling...I can not recommend that anyone buy it unless its upwards of 80% off and your prepared to slug through all the bullshit necessary to actually enjoy it yourself.\n\noh, and in case it wasn't clear...fuck Ubisoft with a thousand sandpaper dildos!",

Honestly, it's just not as fun as Assassin's Creed Odyssey. On the plus side, the npcs in side quest have more variety in their faces, which is better than Odyssey and the graphics are a big step up from the last game. My advise? Play it as an exploration game because focusing on the story gets pretty dull.",

The game's plot is all over the place continuing the Isu are Gods theme from Odyssey which they are not gods. The game shouldn't be this expensive for content that increases the game's time locked behind a paywall.

        "review": "[b]To start with the good stuff:[/b] The game is nice looking and I love the setting. They caught the atmosphere spot on. Old England folk talk is perfect, and there is a lot of content you can do anytime on the side (like Asgard storyline or a certain Roguelike sidestory as Odin), great stuff. Certain \u2018blue\u2019 side-quests were also a great laugh. The auto-pilot for horse and boat is also nice (even though it's bugged sometimes too). Actually want to get dice to play their version of it IRL. \n\n[b]Yeah, that\u2019s about it, now to the bad stuff.[/b]\n[b]First point in Short:[/b] RPG doesn\u2019t really matter in this game, choices are kind of irrelevant. Charisma is only a part of a small minigame and unlocks like 4 options in the whole game. Getting a better horse is possible just by 6 purchasable upgrades. Raven is also completely useless, only for sight-seeing. Got a Unique weekly free item, that was OP for the rest of the game.\n\n[b]The second big point:[/b] Never understood the bad name it had for its length. Since when is a longer game bad? Well you learn by practice. It reminded me very fondly of the terrible design of Mafia 3. You start a region, you finish quests like: fetch, go&kill, go&destroy, and a lot of following of NPCs, until you can get to a big interesting battle / scene at the end. Region done, good job, [i]now do it again![/i] There is a try to differentiate the gameplay by stuffing the main storyline with every single tiny feature (fishing, flyting, drinking, dice, etc.) but the rest is just this repeated design and you have to suffer it through on about 15 regions. \n\n[b]The third point:[/b] Just finished it and already I don\u2019t remember most of the characters. There are Yellow Pages worth of names. They\u2019re presented every few minutes, you will get lost in it too, I\u2019ll bet. [spoiler]And my favourite side character is the only one with off-screen death (phew)...[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Fourth point:[/b] Collectibles. Most of it is just a wall you need to blow up by a bomb hidden somewhere around. That\u2019s it. The whole design. Since half the game, whenever I saw such a wall, I left. \n\nIf they only cut those fillers for each region, made them half the gametime, focused gameplay to quality over quantity (added achievements to steam) and fixed the well full of bugs it has, it would be a great game. [b]Use this as a warning.[/b] I ended up speedrunning since like 70 hours of playtime to call it a day and move to Mirage. Ain't no way I'm going into DLCs. Still recommended due to the points mentioned above, and the fact that until like 30-40 hours I was generally calling it a great game.\n\n[b]So yeah, buy it in a big discount, enjoy until it gets just a bit boring, leave on a high.[/b]\n\n[u]Graphics[/u] = Worth to stop and observe, photomode the crap out it\n[u]Gameplay[/u] = Has it\u2019s bright moments and very fun features, everything gets repetitive by time\n[u]Audio[/u] = Good enough, apart from like two shanties not memorable\n[u]Optimalization[/u] = Might have to upgrade\n[u]Difficulty[/u] = Openworld bosses are challenging, the rest not at all\n[u]Grind[/u] = Unreachable 100%, don't even try if you want to see your kids grow up\n[u]Story[/u] = Some arcs were great, some were not needed at all, so yeah, varied\n[u]Game Time[/u] = [i]It\u2019s been 84 years\u2026[/i]\n[u]Bugs[/u] = Crashes, Critical blockers \u2026 it\u2019s got it all. The longer I played, more critical the state got.\n[u]Audience[/u] = You like Vikings? Then good. You like proper AC? Then not good.\n[u]Replayability[/u] = Now why would you do that? You\u2019ll be happy if you\u2019ll finish it once.\n\n[b]--{ 6 / 10 }--[/b]",

        "review": "I bought the Complete Edition of AC Valhalla for $40 as many people on the internet recommended it. One thing I took note of was the constant mixed reviews regarding the game play and the storyline that was given to the players which was repetitive and boring as compared to the earlier versions of Assassins Creed (E.g Black flag). So I decided to just play it with an unbiased view of the game as I have with other Assassins Creed games.\n\nHere's what I love about this game - \n\nThe Long History of the game: Although they were straying far (hack and slash, assassinations, and the likes) from the original feels from the older versions like AC Unity or Black flag (that includes the dual axe wielding, long list of abilities you get to pick, etc...). This game puts you through a very long and a very exciting history lessons about various mythologies, Vikings, Iceland, Finland and Others. Because of this, I would recommend anyone who hates to sit through boring history lessons in class and play this instead, albeit it has been modified to fit the games objective so you need to research on the actual history to be more accurate, but my point still stands that it is a great game to learn about the history of other countries and mythologies through this game alone.\n\nThe Graphics: My PC is well above the need to run this game at maximum graphics, but of course i wanted to save some VRAMs so that it runs smoothly, which made me put everything to High and Medium instead. Even so, the graphics on this game was amazing and immersive enough for me to not realize that I played for 3 hours (sometimes 5 if i really get myself into the character) without having the need to get off my computer and rest.\n\nThe MAIN STORYLINE: This does not include the other packages that comes with the complete edition and just the Valhalla version itself. It took me 60+ hours just to complete the main storyline and another 80+ hours to complete the other storyline. This MAY seem long (or short if you are a speed runner) but it's such an immersive game that I took my time to enjoy everything this had to offer. If I had bought this game without the complete version at the original price, this would have been worth my time and money.\n\nVariety of Skills and abilities: This game provided with so much skills (either from skill trees, runic skills, Item abilities, Hugr-wrist, Abilities) that will suit the players game play experience. Although this again, strays off the original concept of the older games, I will probably find it boring if they kept using the original concept with no innovation put to it. \n\nHere's what I don't like about the game - \n\nThe mechanics of the game: Back then the game mechanics were way more simpler and easier to understand (I play on keyboard and mouse), so learning the new mechanics of this game was complicated as there was alot of keybinds to remember, which sometimes cause me to press the wrong keybind and losing boss fights (especially with Sutr on Very Hard).\n\nThe Falling Death bug: There are times where I get stuck in a falling animation during battles which just kills me instantly to make me get unstuck, which is frustrating since I was already almost done with the quest. This definitely needs to be fixed but other then that, the game is good and does not affect my overall experience or opinions of the game.\n\nTLDR: If you love immersive, historic and amazing graphics at medium settings, buy the original version, i recommend it. If you do not like to pay for full price, wait for another huge discount like i did and buy the complete edition for $40++.",

        "review": "I've barely scratched the surface of this title, even at 27 hours, but I must say it's a real treat in the AC franchise. There's a lot of the Ubisoft bloat that's in just about all of their games, and it can be quite overwhelming a lot of the time. I will say though, the vast amount of activities you can take part in is very refreshing. Orlog is a blast. Flyting is fun. The drinking games bring you back to the days of house partying with your friends. And just when you think you done all there is to do, you construct a new building in your town and boom, new activity to go off and tackle.\n\nThe Viking aesthetic is absolutely a gem to the series, and England has to be one of their best maps to date. You really get to live out your Norse fantasy here conquering a new land. Plus the fact that when you go into towns here, you have to disguise yourself or people will get frightened and run away is *chef's kiss*. Gives a new approach to the idea of trying to blend in like in older titles.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that it will randomly crash from time to time. Not sure why? Probably a bad patch, and I'm sure it will never get fixed. Thankfully though, the game auto-saves regularly enough that even if you get a CTD, you don't lose much of your progress at all. I do have a second gripe, but it's just universal with Ubisoft as a whole. STOP with the micro-transactions already! I'm glad it's mostly cosmetic, but gating resources behind a paywall is a pretty gnarly move. Granted you can get resources in-game simple enough, but they make it just minor enough to be sort of irritating when it comes to some of the upgrade progression. More reason to get out and explore though, right? (I'm talking resources for upgrading gear early on. This has no effect on later upgrades, nor does it effect the progression of your settlement.)\n\nI definitely recommend really anyone to get their hands on this title, but I would say wait for one of Ubisoft's big sales so you can grab it for real cheap along with the DLC.",

        "review": "\"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" aims to take players on an epic Viking journey, but instead, it's a frustrating experience due to numerous bugs. From frequent crashes to disappearing NPCs and broken missions, the game's technical issues are hard to overlook.\n\nEven though the world is beautifully designed, it's tough to enjoy when the gameplay is constantly interrupted. Simple tasks like looting or fighting enemies often don\u2019t work properly, and the sound frequently cuts out at key moments.\n\n\"AC Valhalla\" has potential, but in its current state, it's too buggy to recommend. Until these issues are fixed, it's more frustrating than fun.\n\nRating: 2/5",
