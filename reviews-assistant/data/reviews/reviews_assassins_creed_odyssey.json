While the vast, open-world is beautiful, it can feel repetitive and is filled with unnecessary quests that drag down the experience. The RPG mechanics, a fresh idea, sometimes take away from the Assassin's Creed experience, making it feel more like an open-world checklist simulator. That said, the story is engaging and the historical setting is captivating, especially for fans of Ancient Greece. If you have the patience for the grind, there's still fun to be had",

I recommend.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter 73 hours of gameplay I can say the game is not optimised properly. About 8 times my game freeze and needed to hard reset the device, 1 time I felt from the map \ud83d\ude02 and once when I jumped from a mountain a got stuck somehow. \n\nNothing major you will just die and start again from last saved file.\n\nThe frustrating part are the game freezes. I have an MSI laptop with 3070TI, I9 12th Gen and 32GB Ram all drivers with latest updates etc.\n\nI'm curious by the time I will complete the game how many freezes I will still get .\n\nDo I still recommend the game ? Yes.\nIs poor optimised? Yes, but maybe not for all devices.",

        "review": "As others have said, this isn't really an Assassin's Creed game, and if you're looking for that experience you won't find it here.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the game is still quite fun. Turn the level scaling down as far as possible and spec into the stealth tree, and you have a [i]decent[/i] if not entirely perfect stealth game.\r\n\r\nThe real draw of the game, however, is its setting. Classical Greece is a history nerd's playground, and to me it was worth full-price simply to explore classical Athens in all its original glory. Many of the historical figures that built the foundation of our real-world civilisation make an appearance, and seem to be depicted relatively well (for the most part). If you have [i]any[/i] interest in ancient Greece at all, including ancient Greek philosophy and theology, this is absolutely worth picking up for that reason alone.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have that interest, though, I'd give this one a pass. It's not a particularly good action game, nor a particularly good stealth game. The story is decent enough, but nothing particularly special, and the side objectives get quite monotonous after a while.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: If you're interested in the story or the setting, pick it up on sale. If you're not, you'll find much better gameplay elsewhere.",

        "review": "Extremely engaging action RPG much in the vein of The Witcher 3 but set in a beautiful recreation of Ancient Greece. It pretty masterfully weaves the stealth elements of the Assassin's Creed series into the action RPG, which is great--there's nothing more satisfying than clearing out an entire camp of enemies before any of them notice you.\r\n\r\nThings I loved:\r\n-The main quest-or \"Odyssey\" has three separate branches that interconnect with each other and the hundreds of side quests. One of these branches involves you hunting down members of an evil cult that's trying to control the Greek world. I found it extremely satisfying hunting down clues to discover the cultist's identities and then finally hunting down and assassinating these targets.\r\n-Many engaging sidequests, and they have player guidance down to a science--you'll be on your way to do one thing, discover a sidequest along the way, and get completely sidetracked and uncover all the cool things to do in each region.\r\n-I played Kassandra and she's such a lovely character who is voiced so well. The dialogue is written well too, I especially loved Athens and getting to have debates with Sokrates, Herodotus, Perikles, and other real historical figures. They're all done such great justice. \r\n-The skill tree has a lot of great abilities, broken down into ranged, melee, and stealth builds. You can respec at any time and try out quite a few different playstyles. \r\n-The game runs like a dream and is beautiful, even on older hardware. I have a Ryzen 5 1600 and a GeForce 1660 and I'm able to run the game at Very High settings 60fps.\r\n-Combat is smooth and exciting. It's pretty well telegraphed when an enemy is going to use a move you need to dodge instead of parry.\r\n\r\nThings I hated:\r\n-Obnoxious, dirty cash shop. I'd recommend engaging with this as little as possible especially the \"time savers\" that give you extra gold, XP, crafting resources--you will farm all you need of this stuff just by playing the game.\r\n-The loot grind. You will get dozens of pieces of gear per hour, most of which is useless. It comes in four varieties: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Common has 1 buff, Rare has 2 buffs, Epic has 3 buffs, and Legendary has 2 buffs but a special Set Bonus when you have the full set equipped. Common + Rare is strictly worse than Epic and Legendary, so whenever you get white or blue gear you might as well sell it or strip it for crafting materials which is tedious. The strongest min-max builds of the game require you rolling a good set of Epic Gear, but honestly you'll have a better time just finding a legendary set you like and rolling with that all game--in which case, the loot grind becomes even more meaningless.\r\n-the timed \"daily missions\" etc are usually not very good but they drop tons of resources and are often convenient enough/on your way enough that you might as well do them. They absolutely feel like filler though.\r\n-I'm finishing up the second DLC as I write this and after 143 hours the game is finally starting to feel like a slog. I much preferred the first DLC which is incorporated into the main game's map, rather than the second DLC which takes you to three separate world maps. The first and third maps of the second DLC look great though.\r\n-Though I understand why it's done this way, the endless level scaling makes it hard to feel like you're progressing much. Also a little immersion breaking when you've fought literal gods and demons and then ten hours later you're fighting random greek soldiers who are just as hard.",

        "review": "Lots of people complain about the generic \"Ubisoft Formula\" for open world games, however this is one of those times where it actually feels good to me. The Greek world is fascinating, for those with even a passing interest in figures of the time, this game provides a fun representation. The combat system is alright, nothing to write home about but no complaints. The DLC has a few achievements locked behind it, but the content itself was quite fun and I feel like it was definitely worth the $12 or so I got it for on a sale. Don't really plan to attempt NG+, but I was overall satisfied with the storyline and characters.",

        "review": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey wouldn\u2019t be among my top five recommendations for someone new to the Assassin's Creed series. Despite its highs and lows, Odyssey feels more like a departure from the core Assassin's Creed experience. For starters, there\u2019s no hidden blade, and the game emphasises action over stealth (even so the combat mechanics can get broken when dealing with a lot of enemies) to the extent of being able to run and do parkour in seemingly any direction and in impossible locations. If the game didn't carry the Assassin's Creed name, I might appreciate it more.\n\nAs someone interested in Greek history, especially Spartans, I enjoyed encountering mythical creatures like Medusa and the Cyclops, and playing as a descendant of Leonidas was cool. However, the game\u2019s grindy nature and heavy focus on action does make it feel less like an Assassin's Creed game.\n\nOn the positive side, AC Odyssey has impressive animations, stunning graphics, and a vast, engaging game world that feels like a giant playground. However, the writing and story fall flat, with only a few moments designed to keep players engaged.\n\nIf you're looking for an action-packed game with a Greek historical backdrop, I\u2019d recommend trying out God of War 1, 2, and 3 first, or even Hades, which has received great reviews. Odyssey would come after those, and that's only because I haven\u2019t explored many games delving into ancient Greek mythology. Overall, I\u2019d give the game a 6.5/10!",

        "review": "I just started this massive game. I bought it on sale. Graphics are unbelievable, there's a lot of controls but configuring it all made it a lot easier. Really what drew me in was the stealth system, I love sneaking up on baddies and taking them out. The original concept of AC was always stealth and staying in the shadows, so I'm def playing in that style and trying to avoid a lot of combat. \nThe leveling system seems easy to learn, less numbers than Elden Ring. It's streamlined. Also the game itself is much easier, sometimes I need a break from tough games. Not saying this is a breeze, but compared to classic Tomb Raider and Elden Ring? This is on the easier side. \nThe open world seems vast, I also love the time period. As I write this, I'm re-watching the TV show Spartacus and this kinda feels like a bigger version of that. Looking forward to seeing the rest of this game.",

        "review": "There are many things to say about Odyssey and I don't know where to begin with. It is a masterpiece. It has been a love and hate relationship with this game. I highly recommend the game, however, you should look into gameplay videos first etc. \r\n\r\nMy overall rating is 7/10. If we were living in a perfect world, it was a solid 9/10. I deducted 2 score points because of the irritating and somewhat frustrating combat. Note, I didn't check on Youtube videos or read any reviews beforehand because I wanted to fully surprise myself and see how it is. \r\n\r\nGood\r\n+ Incredible graphics for the most part but overall for that time of release, it was a superb engine\r\n+ Amazing depiction of Ancient Greece. You can fully immerse yourself in the vast landscape\r\n+ Plenty of missions and side quest (which can have some minor negatives too) \r\n+ Likeable protagonists, interesting characters and some funny bunch\r\n+ Great weapons and upgrade system\r\n+ The story is amazing \r\n+ Honorable ancient people like Sokrates, it was such a highlight for me how he was depicted and featured in the game\r\n+ Great options for decision making in-game\r\n+ Incredible naval experience, oh my goodness\r\n\r\nNeutral\r\n/The map is HUGE. Overall I don't find it negative\r\n/HOWEVER, one can easily get lost and side tracked with other things and mission that has nothing to do with your actual main quest.\r\n/I didn't enjoy the cave missions that required me to go Indiana Jones. \r\n\r\n\r\nBad (Note: This is my PERSONAL view and experience) \r\n- Frustrating combat and GTA-like bounty system. Let me start of saying, when you reach level 99, most of the opponents are level 97-99 too! It was incredibly irritating and often frustrating to fight.\r\n- The game gives an impression I have \"the full freedom\" on how to approach the game and play it. Hmm, the moment when you don't go stealth, you might get a whole city population against you and on top of that, 5 mercenaries. You can buy the bounty off etc but it is still incredibly frustrating. They will also appear on screen when you are about to enter a main quest mission. I don't know why was this flagged during their QA game testing. \r\n- Unfortunately, not all mythical monsters are part of the main story and many of them are linked to side quests and you have no idea which ones without googling. \r\n- A handful of cultists location give a wrong impression. For instance the description says they are in location A. But he's not even there! They are scattered across the maps and you need to do something in order to trigger a certain event, which, where and what??? There were some time I just had to use Google and Reddit and I have to admit, I hate doing that because it somewhat degrades the game experience. But I was so stuck and had no clue what to do next. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, a masterpiece. One of the best AC games. \r\n",

        "review": "It's a beautiful game. I loved the first few weeks playing around. Loved the ongoing fight between Athene and Sparta and randomly side with them, discover places, sail around the galley, jumping and climbing. Looking the cities, villages. Discover islands. Loved that there is not that silly future part shoehorned in it, you pretty much play as that Greek hero and mercenary and slowly discover stuff around.\nThe problem is its not really changing over time. There is no exciting new weapon or armour to play with. They all the same with slightly different stats. The content feels repeating. You may prefer to play sneaky, but there will be forced battles where you just cant play that style. There will be a point when you keep seeing the same type of place over and over again, you keep fighting the same battles and relive the same situations. \nIts not bad but I just can get myself to finish it. After 60hr I felt I just playing circles and saw everything. Maybe I am wrong but I just cant see this game can change anyhow. It's not like ER where you find a new weapon what completely change the way you fight. You cant say you play as an Archer or a sneaky assassin as you keep getting into pit fights where you simply not allow to cheese up the enemy or outsmart it, but bind to play in one way and one way only.\nThe game is huge and can give you content for ages but I feel its just scaled up  without any meaningful gameplay loop change. Playing the Athene - Sparta war is fun for a while.",

I would say worst and terribly made were conquest battles. It could be much better and more immersive if you would have to attack or defend forts and complete objectives as war campaign. But in my opinion they wasted the opportunity for multiplayer which had SO MUCH potential as naval battles and with so many different abilities the combat would be amazing!!!",

        "review": "Holy shit! That's all I can really say lol, nah but there's waaayy more comin haha. \r\nShort story, it's a bomb game and if you're like me and new to the Assassin's Creed franchise, even in 2024 this is absolutely worth the regular price of the game, hands fucking down all the way.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nI've NEVER been interested in the lore behind video games, even after playing WoW for 15+ years and Destiny 1/2 until recently. Almost without fail, every cutscene, every quest RP bs, every lore-related location/mission/items whatever, nothing seemed to capture my attention with the lore. Not sure why because I wasn't really opposed to it, but nothing I experienced in those games, despite being pretty much all about the lore, nothing really brought me into the game in a meaningful way. Now all of that is to say this game changed that for me, seriously.\r\n\r\nI think I remember playing a few hours in the og AC on PS2 I think, but that was a lifetime ago and I consider myself pretty new to the franchise. I was a bit caught off guard when I first fired up Odyssey and saw the frequent cutscenes and deep RPG elements of the game that I apparently wasn't anticipating. Yeah yeah, \"but it's a RPG lol\" yeah I know, but still for a non-lore player I guess I didn't really know what that would look like in-game. That thought lingered for about, well about as long as the first quest, because I was hooked man. It was a weird experience but I was there for it! Now granted my play style is a bit herbally-infused so there is that, but still the level of detail and immersion combined with the fucking 5 star AAA quality graphics, the story writers really shine in this game for real! I haven't skipped a cutscene yet. Yeah there's some repetition with types of activities at certain points, but at about 13 hours in at this point I think, idk it's just captivating as hell man, you gotta try it if you haven't yet! Don't even wait for the sale though for real, it's worth it.",

        "review": "Would definitely recommend buying this game on a discount, perhaps even on it's full price but I'm not too sure about that.\n\nGreat graphics on this one, I really commence the amount of details they've managed to invest in this game considering the scale of the map (which is enormous), also props to Ubisoft for the historical research that they did to make this game, I think they went farther on this one than with AC:O (perhaps because it's a more documented place and time period). The RPG system in this game is much more polished than in AC:O, reminding me more of The Witcher games than traditional AC games (it's the farthest experience from an AC game yet), that's along with it's more interesting and engaging story-line than in AC:O (which is dictated by your choices, yet, it lacks the memory corridors of AC:O), atleast in my opinion. Also didn't face any bugs on this game. Would also mention the side characters being better than in AC:O, however, the main character isn't as well performed as Bayek.\n\nLike any RPG game it does get repetitive and grindy at times. I felt the difficulty on this game was also done better than AC:O (probably due to level scaling which often makes you calculate your steps, atleast on hard/nightmare mode), however the bounty hunters on this game are a bit too annoying than in AC:O since they always teleport an area nearby to you unlike in AC:O where they roam the map and the nearest one to you will head to your direction from where it was if you've done too much mess. Perhaps my only noticeable gripe is that the canon story line seems to fit more the female protagonist than the male protagonist story-line wise but that's what you get for trying to please everyone I guess and it only shows sometimes and doesn't negatively affect the game as a whole.\n\nIt's the only game in the series where you can start playing it since it's so detached from the series as a whole, you might even say it's a different game.",

I liked the aspect of customizing your gear to look any way you wish, but the upgrading system is tiresome since you basically upgrade it every level till it reaches the current one. By the time I explored everything and did all the quests, got around level 88, you also have the option of a New Game plus but considering the repetitiveness and grind, you don't feel much encouraged to replay it especially since you are so high level by the time you access New Game plus and the max level 99, beyond that you will stop getting any xp and everything becomes like a chore.",

Too many grind, a lot of microtransactions. Want something in game? Either pay or spend another 10 hours and even after you will most likely level up and your things won't be so cool anymore. 99 levels? Are you kidding me? And for what purpose? Auto-leveling system won't let you feel your proggression unless you find some cheese strategy. I like Origins location-based system more, but that's just for me. \nOkay, in fact you don't need to have 99 level unless you really want to and it's not the biggest problem of the game. I feel like the biggest problem is world itself for sure. Yes. indeed it is beautiful and devs can have my credit for this, but tell me why it's so...dead and empty? Yes, we have tons of collectables and lots of question marks on the map - much more than Origins have - but even so the desert of Egypt appears to be more lively and enjoyable. I just don't want to explore the world where all I can find is another outpost which is, don't get me wrong, bad for Origins too. Yes some may like it, but for me it is a lazy way to fill the map. \nI can't say anything for the main storyline. It's not bad, it's just fine unless you realize that you have no assassin in assasin's creed game. And even DLC 'Legacy of The First Blade' which could explain a lot of things about hidden blade, how it was created and why such a design, it tells you everything but not about hidden blade. I haven't finished DLC's yet (and I won't, at least right now) but I have seen how it ends and I have just one question: WHY the hidden blade was given to Aya by Cleopatra IF it's Aya's family legacy? \n\nDoes the game have nothing to offer? Well, it is not true. I like mercenary system and cultist system (though it needs to be improved). Combat system is better than it was in origins though why I have paranormal naruto-ninja techniques...okay, it's ancient technology and animus. Okay, let it be. Odyssey also have some fine quests lines, I even chuckled at some of them, but guess that's all.\n\nSome dude once commented my profile and said that 'Origins and Odyssey will be my best experience' and that I should try them necessarily and I was like 'Yeah, sure I'll try them out'. And now I'm dissapointed. I really liked origins, it was not the best game in any way but I had my fun, but here...nothing. And unfortunately Odyssey is the first game in the series which I'm NOT reccomend to buy unless you are fan or it's on a huge discount. Yes, I have heard that Valhalla explains a lot and fixes a lot, but I rate the game here and now and at this condition...No.",

        "review": "Skriv et reviewAssassin's Creed\u00ae Odyssey Review: A Stunning Epic of Choice, Family, and War\n\nAssassin's Creed\u00ae Odyssey is one of the most ambitious entries in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise, offering a vast open world set in ancient Greece and a deep, branching storyline driven by player choices. With breathtaking visuals and a narrative focused on family, war, and destiny, the game delivers a remarkable experience for players looking for both stunning graphics and a long, emotional journey.\n\nHours of Gameplay with Meaningful Choices\nOne of the standout features of Odyssey is the sheer amount of gameplay it offers. With over 60-100 hours of content, depending on how much side content you pursue, Odyssey is packed with quests, exploration, and combat. The game is designed to keep you engaged for the long haul, with a story that unfolds gradually as you make key choices that impact not only the outcome of your journey but the world around you.\n\nThe branching storyline allows players to influence how the game develops. Choices in dialogue and actions can lead to multiple endings and affect relationships with various characters, including friends, enemies, and even family members. The ability to shape the story adds a sense of personal investment, giving the player a sense of ownership over their version of the narrative.\n\nA Story of Family, War, and Loss\nAt the heart of Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey is a tale about family, legacy, and the destructive power of war. You play as either Kassandra or Alexios, mercenaries searching for answers about their family's past while navigating the chaos of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The story masterfully intertwines themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the difficult choices that come with war.\n\nThe game doesn\u2019t shy away from showing how war can tear apart families and destroy entire civilizations. Through your interactions and decisions, you witness firsthand how your choices ripple through the lives of others, whether through forging alliances, protecting your loved ones, or deciding the fate of nations. This emotional depth makes the narrative of Odyssey one of the richest in the series.\n\nSecond-Generation Graphics That Dazzle\nGraphically, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a true masterpiece. The game\u2019s attention to detail, from the vibrant sunsets over the Aegean Sea to the intricate architecture of ancient temples, creates an almost photorealistic experience. The landscapes, wildlife, and historical landmarks are all meticulously rendered, making every location feel alive and authentic.\n\nThe second-generation graphics engine used in Odyssey allows for incredible depth in lighting, texture, and environmental detail, making the game particularly enjoyable for players who appreciate stunning visuals. Whether you\u2019re exploring the depths of a sunken ruin or battling enemies in the shadow of Mount Olympus, the world is breathtaking and a joy to explore.\n",

        "review": "TL;DR Worth the play. 7/10\n\nThis game is really cool at many parts and you can really get into the whole Greek mythology that's woven into the game. I was a little disappointed with the lack of fights with monsters and legends from Greek mythology. I mean the cover of the game shows an epic battle with medusa, but the fight is boring, lengthy, and not very challenging whatsoever. The pacing is a little off as well. The pacing is much better going into the later chapters, but early on the game moves really slow! Other than that, the game allows for multiple play styles and lets you be creative as to how you want to accomplish a task, not too much different than the previous game in the title. \n\nThe DLC's were hit and miss. The Atlantis DLC was great for the first 2 thirds, but had a lacklustre ending. The Atlantis DLC has you fight Gods and monsters, something that I hoped for a little more with the base game, but makes the purchase worth it. The opposite with the Legacy of the First Blade, the beginning just felt like a few side missions and eventually ramped up to a better ending. Getting all the Achievements is a slog, and isn't really worth getting them all to 100%. \n\nOverall if you can get the game with the Atlantis DLC at $50 or less, it's worth grabbing and giving it a try.",

        "review": "Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is not just a game; it's an odyssey in the truest sense, a sprawling, breathtaking adventure that transports you to the heart of Ancient Greece with unprecedented authenticity and depth.\n\nFrom the moment you don the armor of Alexios or Kassandra, you're plunged into an ancient world that\u2019s as beautiful as it is brutal. The sun casts golden rays on the Aegean Sea, casting shimmering reflections that make you feel the Mediterranean's warmth. Each locale, from the dizzying heights of the Spartan mountains to the labyrinthine streets of Athens, is crafted with painstaking detail, capturing the rich tapestry of Greek civilization in stunning, evocative visuals.\n\nWhat sets Odyssey apart is its RPG elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the core Assassin\u2019s Creed experience. The skill tree is vast and varied, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. Whether you want to whisper through the shadows as a silent assassin or charge headlong into battle as a fearsome warrior, the game supports your playstyle with a rewarding progression system.\n\nThe dialogues and choices offered throughout the game have weight and consequence, propelling you into a narrative that is deeply personal yet woven into the grand tapestry of the Peloponnesian War. The story branches in ways that feel organic and engaging, ensuring that no two journeys are the same. Every decision, from engaging in philosophical debates with Socrates to making pivotal choices about the fate of entire cities, shapes your legend in the game\u2019s world.\n\nThe combat is a blend of precision and spectacle. Abilities such as the Spartan kick provide gleefully cinematic moments, while the parrying and dodging mechanics offer a satisfying challenge. The naval combat, a beloved element from previous games, returns with grander scale and strategic depth. Sailing the Aegean, engaging in ship battles, and diving for underwater treasures are all exhilarating experiences that add layers to the exploration.\n\nYet, it's the small details that truly elevate this game. The meticulously researched historical accuracy, the dynamic weather system, the ambient soundscapes that make every environment feel alive\u2014these elements collectively immerse you in a way few games manage.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey is a triumph, a grand tapestry of an era brought to life with passion and precision. It\u2019s an adventure where every island, every myth, every choice adds to the epic saga that is your odyssey. If ever there was a game that proves the power of interactive storytelling, this is it. Highly recommended for both ardent history buffs and avid gamers alike.",

There really wasn't a good reason to make it this big, because after 30 hours you start to notice the exact same fortress, the same bandit camps, the same generic world design on all these islands.",

        "review": "This is more of a review for the AC mythology trilogy as a whole, rather than just AC Odyssey.\n\nMy most recent experience with an AC game before AC Odyssey was AC Black Flag. If memory serves, AC Black Flag was the first major title video game I ever played, and as an all-time great, it absolutely amazed me as a kid and opened my eyes to the world of gaming. While I tried AC Syndicate upon its release, it didn\u2019t resonate with me the same way AC Black Flag did. At that point, the AC series has declined, with little to no innovation, becoming repetitive and boring.\n\nThen I heard that Ubisoft had revamped the AC series, launching the AC mythology trilogy. Since I\u2019m not particularly interested in Egyptian mythology, I skipped AC Origins and started with AC Odyssey as the first game in the trilogy. It\u2019s quite different from the traditional AC games I remember from AC Black Flag, featuring a more warrior-oriented play style rather than the stealth-based approach, which is a common shift across the trilogy.\n\nI don\u2019t dislike this shift like some people do; in fact, I kinda like it. AC Odyssey also features a dual protagonist setup, which is interesting. (My girlfriend and I both played through the game, with me as Alexios and her as Kassandra.) The ending of the story is choice-driven, a first for me in an ARPG. Although there aren\u2019t as many choice-matter situations and possible endings as you\u2019d find in CRPGs, I still find it a nice touch. Overall, it was fun playing through the main story, though I stopped soon after as all the remaining side quests felt the same and repetitive.\n\nI did try AC Valhalla after AC Odyssey, as I\u2019m an even bigger fan of Norse mythology than Greek mythology. AC Valhalla looks absolutely stunning. However, I couldn\u2019t progress through it at all. If AC Valhalla had been my first game in the trilogy, I probably would\u2019ve enjoyed it. But having played it after AC Odyssey, the gameplay was simply too repetitive. With that being said, your favorite among the AC mythology trilogy will likely be the first one you play. Most people probably wouldn\u2019t have the endurance to play a second one in the trilogy, so choose the first one to play based on the mythology that interests you the most.",

Nice hero vibe...\r\n-get attacked by villagers who want to avenge the chikens\r\n-get attacked by each and every soldier in town magically knowing where you are no matter where you hide because you murdered villagers\r\n-have a horde of mercenaries follow you for the next hour of gameplay to collect the bounty you accrued for defending yourself, preventing you from doing anything else than fighting\r\n\r\n0/10 would play again a game punishing you for its own bugs...",
