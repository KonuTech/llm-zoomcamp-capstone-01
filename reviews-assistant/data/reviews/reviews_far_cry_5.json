And the kicker is that my only option is to contact support and when i click on the support link in the window, it does not work. this game is great don't get me wrong but maby you should only buy it through ubisoft so you don't deal with this issue. fuck you ubisoft greedy cucks.",

        "review": "Far Cry 5 is the game that finally answers the age-old question: \u201cWhat if you combined a first-person shooter with a rural American soap opera?\u201d Set in the heart of Montana, it immerses you in a world where you can engage in breathtaking gunfights with cultists, all while secretly wondering if you should have just taken that job in corporate America instead.\r\n\r\nThe game starts innocently enough: you arrive in Hope County to investigate a doomsday cult led by the charmingly unhinged Joseph Seed. But let\u2019s be honest, the real thrill of Far Cry 5 isn\u2019t uncovering a deep and meaningful narrative about the dangers of fanaticism; it\u2019s the sheer joy of watching your character commit insurance fraud by liberating the county from the cult\u2019s iron grip\u2014one explosive barrel at a time.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll quickly find that the cult is armed to the teeth, and you\u2019re armed with\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say your options range from a simple shotgun to an absurdly oversized bear that you can unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Nothing says \u201cfreedom\u201d quite like sending a grizzly bear into a cultist camp, right? Forget about the Second Amendment; you\u2019ve just turned Far Cry 5 into a wildlife documentary featuring armed conflict.\r\n\r\nThe game is a masterclass in \u201chow to annoy your friends\u201d as you drag them into your crazy adventures. Nothing bonds you quite like hijacking a plane and then realizing that neither of you has any clue how to fly it. The resulting chaos is guaranteed to send you both tumbling through the air while simultaneously trying to fend off a cultist helicopter that inexplicably knows how to shoot at you\u2014because, you know, realism.\r\n\r\nAs you roam the stunning landscapes of Montana, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of characters that are equal parts hilarious and bizarre. From a pot-smoking preacher to a paranoid conspiracy theorist, each NPC is a delightful reminder that reality is often stranger than fiction. You\u2019ll find yourself laughing, cringing, and questioning your life choices all at once as you dive headfirst into the insanity.\r\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about the side quests. You can go from saving the world from an apocalypse to fishing with a man who might be the next Hemingway. Because who doesn\u2019t want to take a break from combat to catch some virtual fish? It\u2019s like the game was designed by someone who genuinely believes that balance is key\u2014between blowing up cultists and contemplating the nature of existence while reeling in trout.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Far Cry 5 is less about deep storytelling and more about causing mayhem in the most entertaining ways possible. It\u2019s a playground of chaos wrapped in a satirical package that pokes fun at everything from cult culture to American ideals. So if you\u2019re looking to shoot your way through a beautiful landscape while questioning your life choices and trying not to crash your helicopter, Far Cry 5 is the game for you. 10/10 would unleash a bear on a cult again.",

        "review": "TL-DR:  If you like GTA5 and don't mind some abused religious references, you will enjoy this game.\r\n\r\nGame is reasonably stable, but if you jump to different things, the aging game system starts to show its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nRequires a Ubisoft account to access the game properly. I found this to be disappointing. I don't want/need yet another storefront on my computer to try to toss advertisements my way.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is a bit forced, but there are lots of interesting characters to meet and deal with in this game. There are a lot of religious references here. It is implemented as a way to guide the personas of the BBG and his various henchmen.\r\n\r\nThe guns are interesting and varied. You will probably pick your favorites and keep them going the whole game, swapping things about as needed.\r\n\r\nThere aren't levels as much as there are perks and such to help keep things going. None of this is a bad thing. It all works fairly well as you work your way through the game.\r\n\r\nDriving is a little off. Vehicles are varied and interesting. The physics can be goofy from time to time, adding to the silly nature of the different aspects of the game. I don't like how the NPC's drive. Certain parts are scripted. Those are mostly OK. The rest of the times, they drive like the way your grade schooller thinks driving should be. Yes, they will jack your car from time to time too. Fun, right?\r\n\r\nIn each region, as you progress and move through the story, you'll find the difficulty ramping up in each region. It becomes difficult to do much more than sneak around. Towards the end, I find it a bit oppressive. It makes sense though. You are effectively in a war zone.",

        "review": "Listen, I love this game and it is one of my favorite games of all time in terms of gameplay. The graphics are high end, the gameplay is thrilling, the gunplay is awesome and a lot of things are amazing about this game. But the main problem with this game is the pacing and story. I absolutely love fighting the cult and the overall idea of rebelling against a cult following, but the pacing for the game is really bad in my opinion. Every region other than faith's region feels extremely rushed and hard to follow. Characters such as john and jacob dont have nearly as much screentime or character developement as faith and it sets the tone for the rest of the game after you complete faith's region to be extremely repetitive and boring. Another thing ill say is the car and gun customization is not all that great (guns being better) because unless you buy a specialty vehicle, the only thing you can change is the color which makes it feel like its not really \"yours\" and the color options you do have are extremely boring and bland. No attachments or mods not anything. And even though I really enjoyed this game, I would not 100% recommend this game to most people just because the pacing and gameplay fits a pretty small niche and the story is pretty hard to follow. Still better than FC6 just buy this game on sale if you really want it.  Id say about a 7/10",

That is until a popup for ubersoft came up, requiring me to make an ubersoft account to even install and play the game. This is called bait and switch. I paid my money to own my copy of this game on my computer and they did not disclose ahead of time that you are required to sell your data with another account, made in your name, with another company. Being forced to make a steam account to get PC games now days isn't enough, Now you have to have a steam account and then on top of that make accounts with all the companies producing the games also. These game companies and platforms just keep pushing and violating the rights of customers and they are going to push their selves out of buisiness. IF I BUY SOMETHING WITH MY HARD EARNED MONEY, I BETTER OWN IT AND HAVE ZERO ISSUES WITH PLAYING THE STANDARD GAME I PAID FOR. If it was a free game, then you can pull this shit, but not when a customer pays for the game. It's like going to buy a car, you pay for the car, then when your about to leave the lot, they say you can't leave the lot with your car until you give us any data and information we want for our company and other companies associated with us.",

Story is fine, but if you play with a friend, it's so fun.\r\n\r\nGraphics are decent for a game that came out in 2018.\r\n\r\nMy first issue is the mute protagonist. He/She doesn't add much to the story. Protagonist's story and acting is one crucial part in Far Cry series so you may be put off by the lack of voice from your player character.\r\n\r\nSecond is crafting. There is none. Hunting animals is only limited to earning cash by selling skins. That's all. The real deal is missing. Unlike Far Cry 3/4 where you can skin animals and craft ammo pouches or weapon holsters, here you gotta \"earn\" perk points which is a big turn-off for me. Crafting opens up multiple pathways and this perk point system isn't that rewarding either.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind either of these, then buy it when it's on sale. The map is big enough, you have boats and planes now which are fun to ride. You get a doggo companion (and other ones later on) which is cute and adds to the gameplay.",

It's very repetitive with the same game mechanics we've seen in countless previous Far Cry titles (minus the user choices that were unique at Far Cry 4 for example). The main characters are forgettable and the open world feels lifeless and empty, with little to explore or do. Even the enemy's NPCs literally look the same with minimal variety of look and feel.\nIf you've played the previous Far Cry games, you've essentially played them all.\n\nThe main gem I've found here is the Arcade mode which allows to enjoy micro-missions in community built maps. This is way more fun than the main campaign.",

        "review": "4/10\n\n You know the trope: have you played one Ubisoft game, you have played them all. Your first hours are fun and new, even when you\u2019re familiar with the Ubisoft formula. But the more you venture into the world, you\u2019ll realize its just repetitive slog in every game.\nAnd then , there is this game. Oddly enough, I bought 5 and New Dawn on sale, and played New Dawn first, and had more fun with the latter . There are so many things wrong with this title and I din\u2019t even realize it, most of the time, because  of the fast gameplay loop. Pew..pew\u2026boom. Katshing.\n\nThe map is huge and nice to look at, with lots of things to do. Bet you read that one in many other reviews, So its good value for your money then, right? Maybe, when you don\u2019t think about it.\nIndeed there are lots of mapmakers, a variety of enemies and wildlife, collectables, notes. All the shallow useless activities we know and love in an Ubisoft game.The map is maybe to big for its own good, either way everything feels facile.\nSide missions are solely designed to send you somewhere, kill or save someone. Liberate this, collect that. Hunt that animal, catch that fish, They somehow provide less than nothing to the overall story, some are cringeworthy at their best, maybe a little edgy.  [spoiler]For example. In one mission they literally send you out to examine dog shit.) [/spoiler]\nExploration feels as rewarding as the sound , when you reveal a location. Quick and painless. You\u00b4ll discover a location, maybe your check for clues or ways to get in. You\u2019ll find weapons, which are worse than your weapon of choice. Loot in crates or rucksacks is abundant, but you can\u2019t collect everything because, you have no room in in your inventory. (Some of a gamers worst feelings is to leave loot behind).\nNotes and massages in other games benefit to the world building, here they are just bland, written only to be found. Nearly every note in an abandoned lodge or shelter, tells a story, about\u2026someone, who was here, and is now gone. Or in other notes you\u2019ll discover a cult member upset, that they can\u2019t get in a safe room with good loot, only to find in the next note hints HOW to get in,  And don\u2019t let me start on the collectables. NPCs send you out, in a literal war zone to collect\u2026things. Another mechanic to reveal the map, and waste your time.\n\nGunplay feels pertinent, but that\u2019s an easy feat nowadays, So every gun type feel the same, only the paint job and the numbers were slightly different.. I saved up some money at the beginning, bought a prestige weapon in every slot and stuck to it to the endgame. Even when you unlock other weapons, they are still uninteresting as boring. Same goes for the vehicles. Bought a boat and  a helicopter, with mounted weapons, a small cart for fast map traversal, and didn\u2019t bother with other options, even when I unlocked more and bigger vehicles. Note here, Ubisoft hits you with a shiny special currency in safes\u2026and provides  a shop to buy more, with real money, to purchase weapons, outfits and vehicles. You definitely won\u2019t need to. To benefit micro transactions they unwillingly broke the progression in that regard.\n\n\u201eNew character discovered\u201c! One would think, here is someone important to the story or the gameplay. Besides your followers, most new discovered character provides nothing of value to your immersion, maybe one mission or two, just to sent you out to review more locations.  Main characters have more to say and provide, but are boring either. The gun wielding priest, the sheriff, the redneck, the crazy conspiracy theorist, the woman boss, who doesn\u2019t trust you\u2026.  In all that I often felt so lost, at times in the open world, I wouldn\u2019t recognize  what character is talking to me through the radio, Enemy variety is\u2026well, there is a variety. Grunts with beards, melee with no hair but beards, tanks with helmets and beards. Generic classes, which look all the same. And yes, devs even joke about it, that enemy NPCs have lots of weapons but nothing to shave the beards of.\nAs I heart, in SW:Outlaws you can get mission hints by idle chatter in the open world. Nice idea. Here too, except they have a nice marker above their heads, and the provide useless information and a side quest in your journal. Like I said, nice idea. Until you realize, these are sequenced. One npc in the first region can give you a marker on the other side of the map. Until there is no quests left.  Quickly you\u2019ll forget the little story he gave you with that minor quest. That seems dumb, considering all three factions are isolated in three map sections.  One can only wonder, how to they know about things on the other end of the map? Why don\u2019t they all gather up and fight together against the cult army. Oh right, because you, as the protagonist, with the generic name Rookie, have to do their dirty work.\n\nThat brings me to story.The story was ludicrous and in its presentation often insufferably bad. Like the antagonistic cult, Ubisoft wants you to believe, there is a deeper meaning to all of it, like there was in Far Cry 3, Even worse. I felt a strong detachment to the overall story and my own character. Triggered cutscenes offensively undermine  that little agenda I had as a player with my silent character. Every banter with the four main villains is shallow and meaningless, when you can\u2019t answer anything or even to shoot em in the face, like you do  90%  of the game time. Their speeches were insulting and bloated like like they know you inside out. But the only thing they really can judge  the player character is, how I as they lay death and destruction upon all of them. Oh yeah, know this\u2026you are part of the big plan, which is\u2026.to fill up the resistance meter in every region, to confront the main villain. So the progress in the story also tied to the resistance in said region. Certain milestones trigger events, like radio massages or abductions. I can live with the mechanic, that my adversaries in a certain region mark me, as worthy foe and send out Elites to kill me. But at every big story milestone, they abduct me, only to provide more bloated speeches and a certain way to go back to the regular gameplay. Until the next part. At times I felt offended  by the ridiculous twists and turns it took, triggered by my own progress, and took completely the control out of my handy..  You can\u2019t tell me ,I am chosen to be a part of your big plan, only to send countless followers with assault rifles or rocket launchers after me. I can walk through fogs of this  Macguffin aka Bliss, only to be knocked out all of a sudden, because its time for another story bit. [spoiler]A hallucination literally forces you to unwillingly kill a main ally, only to be told: nevermind, anyway you are the hero.[/spoiler]. And then these endings. I won\u2019t spoil them, but after reading this, you\u2019ll know my opinion.\n\n\nWhy did you play it then, you ask? Because I have this pitiful urge to play my games till the end\u2026 this is type of feeling, Ubisoft is using against their customers. Most of the time I had my fair bit of fun, sneaking up on my enemies. sniping them with my bow or raining down my wrath from my helicopter. Pew,pew\u2026boom!  Katshing. Nonetheless, the turning point was, when I had to catch a fish. Yes. A fish. I tried for five hours on two real days. Even when I knew how the mini game works, I had to look things up, only to read, that the fishing on PC may be bugged, or you\u2019ll have to plug in a controller, then you\u2019ll catch it in 30 seconds. It\u2019s an effing war zone, a world ending plot is going on. People disappear, or die and they send my out to catch a fish. After that I began to write this review, and finished the main story within two hours, didn\u2019t bother finish  some remaining side quests. Overall I am giving this flawed game a cross thumb, because of the fun explosions. But something pulls my thumb down\u2026..",

If only Ubisoft spent time polishing the bad AI and the bugs instead of adding microtransactions to their games, this game would have been better received. Having a separate launcher to play it is also a bummer.\n\nHope County's atmosphere and landscape is breathtaking and the combat feels fluid and awesome. The story is gripping and the villains are terrifying and full of personality. Joseph Seed is a memorable and menacing villain, and this is yet another tale that makes you wonder about morality and the consequences of your actions. There are plenty of side missions and typical Far Cry outposts and prisoners to rescue and secret locations so I never felt bored playing. It didn't feel repetitive to me, since I was always progressing through the story and discovering new sights. Being able to recruit upto 2 AI buddies is really fun (all of the specialists are powerful and really helpful). Driving is smooth and there's lot of vehicles and weapons to try. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Far Cry 5; I've enjoyed every moment I'd spent with it and loved it's story, action, characters and the beautiful open-world.",

I bloody faking hate force into anther platform and on top of that the platform doesnt even work properly\n\n1. the story is mediocre at best with boring characters compares to 3 and 4\n2. SO MANY BUGS: corpses, vehicles, events, spawn in and out here and there.\n3. all the detail just tells the dev isnt put in enough effort/time into this game.\n4. The gun upgrade system is SO LAZY\n5. The ending is just bad.\n6. The stealth mission/outpost is too short and too easy. (I play on hard)\n\nIf you are considering, play 3 and 4.

I click the PLAY button in Steam, it looks like it's launching, then the button changes back to PLAY and doesn't launch. I opened Ubisoft Connect where it asked me to sign in again even though I told it to keep me signed in yesterday. I also had to complete 2FA again even though I checked the box to trust this device yesterday. I jump through those hoops, Ubisoft Connect is now signed in and running, but the game still won't launch from Steam or directly from Ubisoft Connect.

I have a bit of a cult fear and am heavily intrigued by them so I decided to try Far Cry 5 first for the storyline.  After 50 something hours, I completed the game and here's my review- storyline is a 4/10.  It felt very hard to follow, even rushed and not fleshed out.  Mega disappointing that it wasn't more interesting.  Open World Exploration - I love the map and while collecting the perk magazines can feel a bit grindy, I did enjoy.  8/10.  Game mechanics- I didn't have a problem with anything except fishing.  Absolutely atrocious.  0/10 for the fishing.  Overall, I give the game a 6/10.  It's worth a play but maybe buy it on sale.",

I think This could've been one of the greatest Far Cry stories if only the writers didn't go so soft with the message and plot. There are some unique things here that i enjoyed though.\r\nThis game is mostly mindless fun though. Playing with friends would be the best way to expirence Far Cry 5's goofy and silly side.\r\n\r\nBuy This game on sale with your bestie so you can expirience lots of fun messin around in co op.",

        "review": "The game does a good job of breaking somewhat from the structure of previous entries; there is no tower climbing to bombard you with a plethora of map icons (although there are plenty of open word bloat) and the game is divided between 3 antagonist with one additional one at the end being the main bad guy.  Each of his siblings controls a region of the map and each time you complete missions in the region, you make progress toward a confrontation bar with that particular boss.  Also, you can face the siblings in any order and jump between the regions at will.\n\nGameplay is similar to previous far cry entries, and I found I spent most of my time focusing on main missions and clearing out outposts.  Although I admit, I always wasted time with the fishing mini game.  For whatever reason, stealth is much harder in this game than the others and I found it was often not worth the hassle when guns a blazing works just as well.  I would have liked a bit more diversity in guns as I pretty much stuck with the same ones throughout the game.\n\nThe narrative is where things take a turn for the bad.  I did not find any of the antagonists, and certainly not the main bad guy to be particularly interesting.  The acting and voice work is good all around but ultimately, most of the characters fall flat, are one dimensional, and just mouthpieces for biblical nonsense.  My favorite was Faith but even her character is not well fleshed out.  There are some nice twists sprinkled throughout but I think the story is overall weak.  I also found the various capture missions annoying as they pull you out of whatever you are doing in the world at what can feel like arbitrary points.  \n\nOn a technical level, the graphics still look good in 2024.  I wish the developers had implemented something to prevent NPCs from constantly being distracted by the open world.  A near constant issue is talking to an NPC to get a quest but the dialog will get interrupted by some other audio source, random bad guy, or wild life, prompting the NPC to refuse to talk as it thinks its in combat, leaving you to wait around to get the opportunity to resume the quest dialog.  In addition, the game really would have benefited from a third person mode when in a vehicle.\n\nFar Cry 5 in 2024 is still worth your time if you enjoy these types of games.  I have played 3, 4, and primal as well and I would put 5 above primal and somewhere between 3-4 (personally, I liked 4 the best).",

It feels a bit that this game was made for Co-op and there are times when missions are repetitive and boring when you do them alone. Sometimes your character automatically jumps into missions from the main storyline because you've achieved some region liberation level and this can be annoying at times.

Excruciatingly long villain monologues devoid of anything of actual nuance or originality. How do you go from Vaas and Pagan to these cardboard cutouts cliches. It's a good thing you don't get a chance to really bond with any of their characters because the ending makes it completely pointless. Just play literally any of the other far cries instead.

Some points are reiterated too often. And some aren't really developed. The main story is somewhat serious, but most of the side missions are goofy and go into really strange topic (collecting roadkills or launching a teleporter). The writing is all over the place, but if you are willing to put that aside, the main story is ok.\n\nAbout the running and shooting. It's ok, but guns feel strange in some cases. Some enemies are just bullet sponges and you need to drop a whole mag on them or have an LMG as one of your weapons. Shooting feels very arcadey and wouldn't advice this game for anyone yearning for a more milsim shooter.\n\nThe world is quite cool, but it's also too crowded. Pretty much every 100m there are cultists (main enemy) fighting with someone. Yet the whole map seems like low population area (where all these people are coming from?). This is just an annoyance. There are a couple of good locations, but most of them are forgettable.\n\nThe missions are very templatey. Got to point. Kill a bad guy. Catch someone. Etc. However, there are some interesting ideas (like missions where your are collecting bulls testicles for a city fair, or one that will condition you do to something horrible), but they are infrequent.\n\nOverall, I would say it's worth to buy when on heavy sell. It's an interesting game, but definitely it's not worth 60 euros.",

Most of the characters were pretty interesting, there were some puzzles to do, some interesting challenges, you could walk from one point of the mission to another without feeling the need to get a vehicle because things were close to each other. Albeit not the best open world, it was better designed than many others.\r\n\r\nFar Cry 5, on the other hand, is an open world FPS with a very big and a very empty map. All missions seem to be over 1 km away from each other, and without a vehicle or fast travel, getting from point A to point B is daunting. Not only is the game unnecessarily big, it's also empty. At best you'll get to see a barricade and maybe three cultists around the streets while you wait to get from farm A to farm B. No matter how pretty the game looks and how nice the landscapes are, this attempt at an open world is so empty, repetitive, big and boring that I couldn't help but uninstall the game. ~4 hours in the game should be more than enough for things to start getting interesting. Moreover, it doesn't even have the animations that made Far Cry 4 feel immersive, like looting a corpse, skinning an animal, etc. I wouldn't recommend this game.",

Gameplay loop is basically complete some copypaste markers on the map for the bar to fill and here you go your reward is story mission with a cutscene. As a CO OP game i guess its alright but overall pretty blend",

        "review": "Only (the gunfights) are fun, yet disappointing, with lots of mods installed. without mods- If I could describle this game in one word it would be pathetic.\nEmpty world, hardly any variety. Even the purportedly climactic parts of this game are laughable. Gunfights are braindead if you try whatsoever. Yet 1/100 enemies will be a gunner who needs 5 clips to kill for some reason. One of like the 3 enemy types in this game. Loot is always the same. I think an enemy has thrown a grenade at me twice ever. Enemies are braindead. You can win a 20 v 1 with even a single tree as cover. I had to fire my GFH so i could even have fun shooting the minimal enemies (Which is the only fun you'll be having in this game.)\nEnemy movements and reinforcements are predictable, slow, unnatural loud. Most outposts are disappointing. Missions feel like mmo missions not a AAA game with cool stuff and excitement. Random encounters are anticlimactic. No hunting practically. Most NPCs are annoying with cringe forced humor. Guns for hire say a cringe one liner every 20 seconds eliminating any atmosphere. Speakers with the bosses droning on with creepy cringe speeches that you cant turn off. Annoying music blasting in many areas. Enemy encounters feel dumbed down from previous titles. \nLack of weapon variety. All enemies drive the same cars in the same fashion. Climbing towers is not fun. Missions don't feel exciting or natural like previous games. People you need to speak to are constantly interrupted. Frustrating forced encounters with un-skipable cutscenes. No NPC variety. If you are religious just put down your headset and get a drink when cutscenes start because it will make your skin crawl.\nThe game tries to be sarcastically humerous, yet also tries heavy handedly to tug at your heartstrings, and tries to get you to fear enemies and hear these ridiculous tales of cruelty and violence, yet when you meet the enemy, it's just another of the same enemy you've been fighting the whole game. I think they stopped planning this game past the opening sequence because that is the only fun part of this game! It sucks because that sequence sets the stage for this awesome interesting and great looking world with sick animations. And then when you really play, it nothing like that! I can keep writing but i'm going to force myself to stop here before i pop an artery",

Tried playing again on PC in 2024 and still just as buggy. De-synced audio in opening cutscene, had to play the first gameplay section 3 times due to vehicle randomly getting stuck and exploding. Played for awhile and during one of the daredevil stunt race missions, the vehicle kept spinning during the countdown and then starting me facing the wrong way. Got fed up and stopped playing.\r\n\r\nKnowing how the game ends, I have no motivation to play the story out anyway. This game is a mediocre, buggy disappointment.",

Can we please bring back the programmers that was writing the story? How about bringing back the office staff that was playing characters?

        "review": "Definitely my favorite Far Cry, I've played it through three or for times now. It's nice to have a game like this set in the U.S., though I can assure you people that don't live here that our animals don't attack us in real life as frequently as they do in this game, nor do we actually own so many machineguns. Also, even in the most remote parts of the U.S., I doubt a cult could cut off the outside world as depicted in this game. \n\nThe best part of this as compared to other Far Cry games is the guns for hire, you can have two, humans or animals and combine them however you wish. There are plenty of interesting humans to choose from and they all have their own unique voice lines. \n\nBasically, they could just keep adding missions to this forever to have more to do, and I would never need to play any other Far Cry again. Wish they would. I'd gladly buy extra missions for this game to keep playing in the Hope County setting but get to do something new in it.\n\nAlso, the music is fantastic. Check out all the different versions they did of the original music for this game on YouTube sometime, there are some super-catchy tunes in here. They definitely took the music for this game seriously and make it top-tier. The pause menu  music is so relaxing and chill that sometimes I pause just to listen for a few minutes.",

        "review": "After 2 playthroughs I gotta tell you, Far Cry 5 is one of the best Far Cry games, if not the single best of them. I sometimes say that a game has been \"polished to excellence\" and I don't say that frequently, but FC5 earns that title with its fantastic story, pleasant gameplay, and attention to details.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Great graphics, like Far Cry games have always had.\r\n- Amusing gameplay. Mostly what you always expect from FC games, but a little better than previous titles with all the tools that it puts in your hands.\r\n- Fantastic music and sounds! This is one of the fields that the game really shines in, with all the beautiful menu music, songs and, really, works of art. I mean, was it even necessary to make all those damn fine pieces of cult music? Don't blame me if the \"only you\" track by The Platters gives you creeps from now on though. :D\r\n- Story. As you know, FC games have frequently been criticized for their story. I think FC5 has one of the best stories in FC series. It shows the subject of religion and cults and psychological manipulation well, and at the end leaves the decision if the father was right or not in your hands.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Stealth kind of becomes useless in harder difficulties cause enemies detect you so easily.\r\n- John's character is a bit weaker than the other lieutenants. Faith and Joseph himself are good, Jacob is freaking awesome, but John is not that good. He's a sadist, so what?  He needed more work.\r\n- That Eli moment is so horrible and sad, and there's no way around doing it. I know it ultimately makes the game more memorable, but what the hell! \ud83e\udd2f\r\nNot even sure if it's a pro or a con...\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great game. I loved playing it and totally recommend it. :)",

Also, the game initially opens with a 10 minute cutscene that is REPEATED if you manage to die afterwards. If you're like me and enjoy testing the bounds of what you can and cannot do in a new game, then you'll be watching the intro twice. \n\n0/10 I would rather watch paint dry than play more of this game.
