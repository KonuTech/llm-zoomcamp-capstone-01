Incorrect button shows, unclear save points, performance issues, awkward voice line moments, portruding jaws in some cutscenes, illogical story moments, etc. Even so, I still find it enjoyable. If you plan on getting, wait for a maaaaaassive discount as what it is now is the equavalent of paying 50 euros for a dominos pizza.",

For instance, whenever you try to throw a fire spear, you have to hold down the button to do so. Well while in movement, she will sword attack instead which is super irritating because she always lunges at the enemy. I'm trying to keep my distance, not get slaughtered under a mutant because you can't do the key command I want to do. Took the fun out of the game and I decided to set this one down. Also the lock on for swinging is annoying. why you cant have a key appear mid flight like every other game baffles me. Too many complicated movements when it could have been FAR more fluent.",

Either I'm just really good or this game isn't as difficult as some other games I'm used to like Horizon. Great game. Only complaint I have so far is that the main cast of characters is all females. Antagonist and protaganist alike. Feels like a feminist picked the characters genders. I don't mind women being at the center point as long as it increases the stories and games value and makes sense with the plot but this is just glaringly obvious. As of now there's no reason at least one of the Tantas could have been male. I feel very under-represented. I like going through the main story and learning about the lore but when games ask me to start reading about the lore that's where I lose interest. But not with this game.

        "review": "Pretty fun game overall. Like most games that are of middling or good quality, they get swept under the rug especially when they have a marketing failure like this game did. Early reviews are all copy-paste complaints about some of the writing, when the writing itself is fine. Actually refreshing having a character act somewhat real instead of games where characters act like cliche's when they have a supernatural setting.\n\nAlso the story was going somewhere pretty decent.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty good, and keeps getting better the more you progress. There are obviously portions where you feel the dev team could have used more time to make a better game, but it's just a case of high ambition ruined by some corporate meddling (the deathblow to any AAA game as once you sink the cost, pulling the plug early is a disaster almost certainly).\n\nDLC also was pretty refreshing, and the combat was more engaging and had you more engaged in constant action.\n\nThe music was the only real downside I perceived constantly. The ambient music is alright I guess, but the combay and higher tempo stuff is just the typical uninspired garbage dreamed up by a classical orchestra. Very one-note linear and trumpets and horns.\n\nGraphics are pretty good too (not something you can say a lot about most games these days), but the overall world design itself isn't that great due to the desolation. Particle effects are great. Though this game (like literally every other, other than Red Dead Redemption 2), has had their shadows severely downgraded compared to reveal footage of the game.\n\nThis is an overall fun game due to the movement and power fantasy genre it wants to live in. This genre doesn't have too many games worth of note, and the last one I can recall other than things like Spider-Man 2, would be the older Prototype games in the PS360 era. We need more games like this that are fun with movement, and combat.",

Enjoyed the story and gameplay loop.\n\nCons - Main character is a bit grating until near the end game. Reluctant hero that goes almost to the end before she starts to become likable. Performance on a 4090 is fine when your turn rtx off except for when you are in particle heavy combat sequences. \n\nOverall recommend on sale. Current price is too much for a pc game and the hate surrounding it early on was probably due to the price and people jumping on the \"this game sucks\" bandwagon \n\n",

Dialogue is campy and fun, and the plot, while based in a very heavily overused trope, takes some fun turns that I genuinely didn't see coming. The biggest disappointment for the game, for me, was 114 hours in when I ran out of game to play. This is the gameplay experience I wanted to get from FFXV.",
