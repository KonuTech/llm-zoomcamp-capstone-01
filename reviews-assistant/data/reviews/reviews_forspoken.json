The combat and movement are both fantastic, some of the best I have come across and I plan to continue clearing the map while hunting achievements.\n\nSadly the story feels rather undercooked. The broad strokes of the narrative are solid, but the execution falls flat. Dialog is rather hit or miss. The graphics are alright overall but the facial animations are... not great. \n\nOverall game is definitely worth picking up in a sale if you want to have fun blasting things with magic.",

For instance, whenever you try to throw a fire spear, you have to hold down the button to do so. Well while in movement, she will sword attack instead which is super irritating because she always lunges at the enemy. I'm trying to keep my distance, not get slaughtered under a mutant because you can't do the key command I want to do. Took the fun out of the game and I decided to set this one down. Also the lock on for swinging is annoying. why you cant have a key appear mid flight like every other game baffles me. Too many complicated movements when it could have been FAR more fluent.",

        "review": "Its honestly not a bad game. The story isn't as horrible as some made it out to be, not the best but had interesting points and there are a few characters i found myself caring for. The banter between Cuff and Frey while exploring adds a bit of fun too. A lot of people don't like Frey but i think she builds into a better character overall as you progress though the game and she has grown on me as a character so far.\r\nMany people judged her only on the first few impressions they got of her, i understand first impressions are the best but if i placed myself in her shoes and if i was warped away to a different world and could control magic i'd possibly have a similar reaction. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot to explore, I find myself discovering all the different locations and doing the side missions before i move on. Each place you finish will make you a little stronger with new spells, gear, or stat increases.\r\nOverall the graphics are quite beautiful as well and there are some stunning locations. \r\n\r\nCombat is very fun, you can dash, jump, flip, and everything else while fighting and shooting out spells and there is a nice collection of different ones you can use. You can also switch out spells while fighting at a press of a button making it so you can combo your spell or switch to a defensive spell if needed quick. It feels very fluid and mixing movement and attacking is pretty well done. \r\n\r\nI also can't comment on any lag, stutters, or anything like that. I am able to run the game on ultra settings without issue. The only graphical \"\"issues\"\" are the fires and skybox (some areas) in the game are look very low res and can break immersion a bit with how out of place it can look. \r\nI also did not buy the game at release so i cannot comment on previous issues regarding that.\r\n\r\nI don't think this game deserves the hate it gets and I really am enjoying it and truthfully the only thing i can say you shouldn't do is buy it full price.\r\nWhile i've given the game a lot of praise the price is not what it should be at and i feel it should have been $40 to start. The game isn't very long and while i am taking my time and exploring everything i see i am already about halfway though the game and taking my time and while i am having fun it's the kind of game for me personally i will do everything i find fun, finish the main story/DLC story and then uninstall. This really feels like a 1 time play through type of game but something you should give a try. \r\n\r\nSadly there will not be a 2nd game or more added to this world and that makes me a bit sad. I feel like the devs could have made the 2nd game a lot better taking the feedback they were given with this but too much at launch and other issues made the studio close (Merged to work on different Square games iirc). \r\n",

It has been out for over 18 months (only bought it because it was $20) and even on the lowest graphics settings it still stops and stutters between 10 second dialogue scenes that jump right back into another loading screen. You cannot even move around the map screen or the starting city (that is loaded separately from the open world) without it stopping you to load a new section time and time again. The fighting and movement can be fun if not a bit repetitive in the early stages and the story does make you want to keep going to find out what is in store. But again it was far too ambitious as getting that far in is a bit of a nightmare. Getting it so cheap is the only reason I didn't refund after the benchmark alone.",

Performance on a 4090 is fine when your turn rtx off except for when you are in particle heavy combat sequences. \n\nOverall recommend on sale. Current price is too much for a pc game and the hate surrounding it early on was probably due to the price and people jumping on the \"this game sucks\" bandwagon \n\n",

I fully recommend nabbing this game when it's on sale. \n\nForspoken has some great gameplay concepts that make it feel very unique in the current gaming landscape. The game's story and writing has received much criticism, but I feel like a lot of it is just hot air and reactionary chatter. There is a compelling emotional journey within the game that is presented in a way that is not a lot of people's cup of tea, so to speak.\n\nThings I love about Forspoken: The parkour is really fun and fluid, the fast traversal feels like an action RPG married to the speed of a Sonic game, the combat options that open up by endgame are fun to mess around with, the instantaneous load times, the mostly female cast, the unique world that is built out kind of like a Souls game (it's a world that fell to ruin, and you find out how that happened throughout the game and by reading lore)...\n\nThe particle effects are really cool and give this game a unique visual identity. I understand that the world is a bit singularly focused on finding battles and trials and collecting things, but even after I take a break, I often feel like returning to the world to run around and fight monsters. \n\nThere was a lot of potential for this game as a series--this is basically the Assassin's Creed 1 of something that could have been iterated upon and polished throughout the years. But alas, it is not meant to be. Still, what we have is a flawed gem of a game that has some really unique gameplay systems that we will likely not see again.\n\nLuminous Productions will be missed.",
