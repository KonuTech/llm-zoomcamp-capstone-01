        "review": "Shadow Gambit is Mimimi's crowning achievement. Made in the rather niche genre of stealth strategy this game has you take a crew of pirates across several isles and spy on and assassinate the inquisition. Each character has two abilities which can be highly different from the others; for example Suleidy can spawn a bush to give you cover to hide in almost anywhere. This allows you to find different angles of attack and take care of bodies easily. Meanwhile Toya can place a beacon in a small radius around him, and then teleport back to it from anywhere. Really useful when trying to infiltrate a centralized position as you can place the beacon in a bush, sneak in, shank a guy, then teleport to the exact opposite side of said compound while the inquisition fruitlessly searches for you. \r\nA big risk this game takes is with its openness. After the first three missions to get your sea legs under you, you have a choice of which of the several islands to go to next. Additionally, if that wasn't enough, after you get the first character, Afia Manticato, you have a choice of two, and then after that, all the rest. Desperadoes 3 and Shadow Tactics, Mimimi's previous games in this genre, had each character limited to certain missions and the missions were in a set order. While I have heard complaints that this causes each mission to be unable to be made with exact characters in mind, I think there is much to be gained from the many choices available. I wouldn't want it to be done with every game in this genre, but I applaud Mimimi for taking this risk. \r\nThe characters have interesting personalities, and varying backstories. From Gaelle who accidentally shot out her stomach with a cannon ball, to Toya's belief that cooking is a war he doesn't intend to lose, each of them are larger than life. \r\nThere are also two dlcs, one of which reintroduces Yuki from Shadow Tactics, and the other Zagan, who has some interesting abilities. He can render enemies catatonic from range, but it costs him a hit point. No matter, his base melee attack restores a hit point. Very interesting use of health as a resource, in a game where you don't have much of it.",

So, can't take it serious, too childish or women-oriented. You really want to see a strong woman character? Play the first game. It was released many years ago, but the story is way better than this (but the graphics remained the same, cool right?). Well, I don't know why Mimimi was shut down, but at this point I am not even interested.
