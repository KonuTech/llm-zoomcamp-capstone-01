The concept of the game is not bad and the game-play itself is one of a kind, hell it has the potential to be the best of it's kind (Swordplay) but the overall mechanics and balance of the game is trash. First thing first, The majority of the people who play this game are Viking lovers, so that faction gets the most upgrades and buffs of all kinds, while everyone else gets Nerf. Now I play the samurai faction, Orochi (a samurai hero) who literally gets Nerf after every patch, for really no reason at all while OP characters continuously gets buffs. It's crazy. Here's an example of the unfair balance, Berserker, a viking character, gets hyper armor with every attack (including light attacks) despite not having no armor at all. Shaman (a viking hero with a dagger with one hand and a hand axe in the other) inflicts more damage than characters who are wielding full size swords with two hands. Hitokiri ( who is a samurai hero, but has a western weapon called the Double-sided war axe,) swings faster than most characters and does tons of damage on top of that, and does a ridiculous one shot back flip move while you're getting jump by other players. I can go on and on but imma stop there, and i'm pretty decent at the game so it's not like i don't know what i'm talking about I get wins in almost every game, but facts is just facts. Anyways, I hope this helps. All love and peace.",

Learning a new character is pointless because you will either get double teamed or fight someone that abuses stupid mechanics like bleed. If you want mental problems this is your game. :)\n\nAlso why can you bleed while in revenge.",

But as solid as the gameplay is I dont think it can carry the game forever with the dogshit management Ubisoft is putting out here. \r\n\r\n Budget is probably not even a fraction of the flops after flops Ubisoft has been releasing so content updates are basically low quality animations and reskinned outfits. Balance updates are very scarce so problematic characters stay the same for a very long time. As a Ubisoft special servers suck dick so expect atleast 1 person from either team to disconnect every game and pray its not on your team so you dont have to play a very hard to win match for no reason. \r\n\r\n Speaking of winning, there is no reason to 'want to win' other than for the sake of it because only one mode (1v1) has ranked and it is practically dead. Nobody plays ranked so you either wait a 5 to 10 min queue for a very unbalanced match or just play normals for fun forever.\r\n\r\n With all these taken into consideration, it is hard to recommend the game, which is a shame really because the core gameplay is very unique and fun.",

In year 8, For Honor gives new players access to each main faction's four original warriors of the Vanguard (Balanced), Assassin (Attacker/Damage-Dealer), Heavy (Tank), and Hybrid (Mixed/Unique Gameplay) characters, with the exception of the Wu Lin who give only their vanguard and assassin classes, and the \"Miscellaneous\" Outlanders faction of just all hybrids so far. As for gameplay, you have two large-scale modes of 4v4 with minions, and smaller modes of 1v1 duels or 2v2 brawls, and heroes for both players that want challenging learning curves with their heroes, or alternatively mindless fun (Looking at you, Ocelotl players). Lore was a bit of a mess in previous years, but year 8 is particularly promising with its lore as of year 8 season 3, as this season focuses on factions of knights, vikings, and samurai, instead of the covenants like Horkos and Chimera. I at the very least recommend trying the campaign, and maybe even just getting the game while it is on sale, such as when new heroes are released.",

Same idea for Rainbow 6 Siege.\nExample, new Shaolin monk is such an easy character to play with all its lightining-fast attacks and attacks with lead into immediate heavy and light attacks.\nAlso, some heroes just don't have sweeping attacks?

        "review": "Ah, For Honor. Or should I say For Torture? You know a game is great when you spend more time questioning your life choices than actually playing it. It's like they took the mechanics of combat, ran them through a blender, and dumped them out in the middle of a lag-ridden, glitch-filled wasteland where \"honor\" is something you\u2019ll never experience.\n\nThe combat? Imagine trying to juggle three flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Blindfolded. That's about as intuitive as it gets. Who needs balance or skill when you can just get obliterated by a Viking with the hand-eye coordination of a potato?\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the online experience, which is basically a 50/50 gamble on whether you\u2019ll be matched with an opponent or just a loading screen that lasts longer than your will to live. But when you do finally get into a game, you're welcomed by the soothing sounds of your teammates hurling insults at each other because, let\u2019s be real, that\u2019s the true \"community spirit\" here.\n\nThe story mode? I didn\u2019t even know it had one until I accidentally clicked on it, and I wish I hadn\u2019t. It\u2019s like a rejected script for a knockoff Game of Thrones fanfiction, but with less coherence and more facepalming.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a masochist who loves the sensation of repeatedly slamming your head into a brick wall while listening to prepubescent kids yell obscenities, For Honor is the game for you. For everyone else: save your time, save your money, and save your sanity.\n10/10 would recommend",

You will hate that you love this game. \n\nNever before have I played a game with such promise which is why it hurts that i feel the need to write this. \n\nIll start off with the pros i guess: \nGreat fighting SYSTEM (specifically the bones of this system)\n\nReally cool universe and characters\n\nThat's about it.\n\nNow, the negatives: \nBroken, buggy mess: Hits will sometimes not connect, or you will lag, or fall off a small piece of terrain, or not getting revenge when you should, or opponents getting revenge when they shouldnt, (this is vice versa btw, I've had BOTH ways)\n\nLack of effort: Every new hero released or patch dropped I find something to complain about. Whether it be buffs/nerfs that aren't needed, or just the fact they wont fix the broken revenge system, which has been broken for a very long time. Heros release with little to no cosmetics, and the ones they do release with are often just slightly changed from other versions. And you better be OK with wasting 20 hrs of your life to try and make them not look like hobos. Breach hasn't gotten a new map or any substantial changes in over 4 years, who does that? \n\nTeammates: This game will make you an introvert I swear. Never before have I played with such terrible players. It is quite literally like having small children playing your multiplayer game with you. Wether they have no patience and will feed revenge on someone you had no problem with, or they'll end up killing you in some way. They do not pay any sort of attention and will (most of the time) be an active detriment to your gameplay. Seriously, I'm not joking, out of 10 games you will be lucky to get 1-2 with ONE good teammate and sometimes even that doesn't happen. \n\nAnd Ubi needs to keep dropping new heroes because this game is losing players like a bucket full of holes and needs to squeeze every last cent out of this game before it crashes and burns which seems to be soon if the low player count in breach and the medium player count in dominion are anything to say and I for one can't wait till they put this game down and either come out with a new one that actually fixes this game's problems and turns it into the special beast I know it can be, but right now, this game is struggling, squirming in its death throes before its last gasp which i imagine will be coming with the next few heros. The devs have given their all, but its no match for the morbidly obese weight that Ubi likes to put on them. I thought I finally had a good fighting game to play all those years ago and to see it die like this hurts, hopefully it can rise from its ashes someday but I dont see it happening anytime soon.",

And now all characters play the same.\r\n[b] Get into your 50-50 setup -> hit -> wait for stamina -> repeat [/b]\r\nYou get about 50 coins for a duel. Buying an effect costs 5000 coins. You have to buy it separately for [1.] Your executions, [2.] Idle Emote, [3.] Free roam emote, [4.] Combat Emote.\r\nEnjoy playing (20.000/50=) 400 duels, just to have some stock unity wind effects swirl around you (or buy the same amount of coins for 20\u20ac! Get the battle pass too while you're at it, oy vey!!)\r\n\r\nVery boring. Very grindy. Everyone is angry. Ranked matches have been in Beta for at least 4 years, and half of all gamemodes are dead and deserted.\r\nWould not recommend",

        "review": "I started playing for honor in the open beta great game felt in love with the combat the graphics are good and its just a fun fighting game but thats the only good things. For the bad things, first newcomers there is no way for people that want to give this game a try because this game has a big learning curve and most of the people i tried to get on for honor just fell behind because they got matched against people that are already good thats for most matches so newcomers have no way to learn the basics so they just quit reason: they find the mechanics unforgiving and lose intrest to learn them, yes there is a training arena or tutorial but those teach you only inputs in my opinion. Second problem as for rainbow six seige to unlock a new character it takes to much time yes they give you some characters for starting out based on your faction but you will only own 3 normal characters the other from the faction are just there you can play but you cant customise them or anything and the 3 base characters are really boring. Third problem broken mechanics this game has many mechanics that are just unfair in many scenarios like for example light spam, gladiator toe stab, centurions punches these mechanics just make some characters broken and some too weak to play but i get this is a problem that cant be changes because its a fighting game where every single character has different mechanics they cant be all perfectly balanced. Fourth problem the servers ubisoft doesnt give a fuck about games so they also dont care to make good servers if someone in the game has a minor lag it will result in the match cancel kicking all players mid game or just individuals. Fifth problem i hate micro transactions so for a game of a money hungry company like ubisoft what do you expect so many skins, battlepass, in game currency to buy cosmetics but it has a bright side to  it you can get this things for free but you have to grind so much that the games fun is drained out of it. For my opinion good game but has many problems that you can get around its up to you.",

I want to remind you these are the negative reviews.\nBut fuck it, if you're reading this review then you either know me personally or can make this observation for yourselves. \n\nThis game slaps, I sincerely feel the Devs' respect for the players and believe it's honestly worth being cringe for a sec, dropping the memes and acknowledging this rare example of a AAA publisher allowing a title to do something different and still as relevant as it is after 7 years.\n\nEnough boot licking though, I was too scared to try any other hero till my warden hit rep 50 and this game has done longterm damage to my mental health.

I have used an old account used by me and another family member back on ps4, thinking it would transfer over. After seeing nothing made it over and instead logged me into their own For Honor account I made my own account and tried to transfer ownsership of the game to it to no avail nor help from ubisoft support. i have spent only so long in my family members account that they said I could use since they were no longer going to play this trainwreck of a game, until an update to ubisoft connect logged me out, and now if I open for honor I only get a ubisoft connect window that says it has trouble verifying ownsership, with a Support button that does nothing when clicked. Do not get this game.",
