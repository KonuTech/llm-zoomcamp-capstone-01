        "review": "I bought this game with a very steep discount and with low expectations. It's pretty fun but with some weird design choices.\n\nThe things l liked:\n- the combat is mostly fun with some of the weapons being really great to use - however, some of the special weapons were too niche to equip since you would only use them every now and then, and they took up precious space in your limited loadout\n- exploring the world was fun and made easier with lots of travel options\n- good voice acting (mostly)\n- beautiful visuals and music\n- decent companions for loud and stealth\n- stealth was well done and I really enjoyed places that I could use it (including an overpowered build with a rifle that shoots through walls)\n\nThe things I didn't like:\n- The clothing system is annoying as it replaces an actual skill tree. You can't unlock abilities, increase damage resistance etc. No, you need to equip clothing. Oh I'm a fighting a flamethrower - let me open a menu and put on different gloves. Now an enemy that poisons me? Ok, let me go back to my inventory and change my head gear. Oh, wait, stealth, let me change my pants. It's annoying, unimmersive and a waste of time\n\n- Limited loadouts meant that I didn't use most of the weapons and gear. Only 4 loadout slots with three weapons each? I never touched some items as I wasn't willing to use up a slot on gear I would only occasionally need but it would have been nice to have quick access to them in those niche moments.\n\n- Annoying characters. I understand that the player character is always going to seem more competent than everyone else and that you are always being sent out on errands. But many of the NPCs in this game are not just useless and incompetent but ungrateful and dismissive of the things you do to the point of being unlikeable.\n\n- Lots of bugs, including missions that don't finish, visual bugs and the usual Ubisoft jank.\n\n- The ending was stupid and made it feel like the whole game had been pointless.\n\nIt sounds like I have a lot of complaints (and I do). But the gameplay loop of fighting enemies, exploring and trying out fun weapons like rocket launchers and bolt-throwing crossbows is super fun. However, I recommend buying it on sale and go in with low expectations for the story, characters and character progression. I also recommend using the Libertad mod which adds some nice QoL upgrades, including a better save system since the base game one is abysmal.",

        "review": "So, so much work went into something so bland and disappointing.\n\nFar Cry 6 is the latest Far Cry game trying desperately to recapture the magic of Far Cry 3 and failing completely. It is a visually gorgeous bloated mess of meaningless content, boring gunplay, and terrible characterization. It's yet another example of a game made by many teams who seemingly never talked to each other, leaving FC6 feeling like a bunch of systems mashed together and called a game.\n\nStory is the most obvious place that FC6 falls flat. The player character, Dani, has one motivation: leave the island of Yara and travel to America to be free. At the very start of the game there is a point where you can choose to do just that, to get on a boat and go, and that point is the last time Dani feels like they're following an understandable motivation. If you chose not to, Dani gets dragged into a revolution seeking to free Yara from a tyrannical dictator. This is admirable, but Dani never, ever seems to want to be there; because everything you do you are told to do by NPCs, Dani has basically zero agency, and that lack of agency hangs over the entire game.\n\nAt one point your \"mentor\" guerilla takes Dani aside and says that he sees something within, something similar to himself, a desire not to win a revolution but to fight eternally, a guerilla forever. Dani's reaction to this is basically, \"No,\" and this desire to be a life-long mercenary never really comes up again until the literal last moment of the game when Dani says, \"Yeah, screw leading this country to peace, guess I'm a guerilla for life.\" Cool. Amazing characterization. The truth is (as in most Far Cry games) Dani is a cypher; put whatever you want on them, it doesn't matter. But hey, at least the villain is good, right? A hero is defined by their villain.\n\nAnt\u00f3n Castillo is the ruler of Yara, and he's intelligent and dangerous, a man who has hung onto power as a dictator with an unstable regime for years. He's kind to some, ruthless to others, and he should be a formidable foe. But that's the Castillo from cutscenes. The gameplay makes him look like an idiot because there is some major ludo-narrative dissonance going on.\n\nThe dissonance here is that Castillo never really defends any territory that's his or does anything intelligent. Ever. Even inches from his front door you can take a vehicle checkpoint and it's yours for the rest of time. And it's piss-easy to take as well, always around 5 guards who never pose a threat from the very beginning of the game all the way to the highest security levels at the very end. This is a game design failure stemming from a desire to have lots of content in the game: no content ever feels significant, even the most important parts. And there's so much content that, if you chose to have the enemy faction re-take their territory, it would be overwhelming to a player just trying to take their 20th or 30th checkpoint.\n\nThe story is predictable in every way. You beat back Castillo's forces, take control of regions, and meet the folks fighting with you. Because this is Far Cry, most of those characters are as annoying as they could possibly be, almost pastiches of real characters. Hey, it's easier that writing real people, right? So you make allies and tighten the noose around Castillo's neck, and then you come to the end game: actually attacking them. And then, ladies and gentlemen, characters start picking up the Idiot Ball.\n\nThe leader of the revolution decides to meet the ruthless dictator for a one-on-one chat. Wow, it was a trap. I'm so surprised. Dani goes to rescue her and ends up in a stand-off. The guerilla mentor character doesn't have a perfect shot of Castillo during this stand-off, despite being able to see where he's standing through the lens of a high-power sniper rifle, so decides to try to kill Castillo's son, getting the leader of the revolution killed. Castillo himself, at the very end of the game, [spoiler]murders his own child (in what I'm sure some writer thought of as a shocking moment) despite the fact that Dani has protected the kid through the whole game and would continue to do so.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's just so dumb.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's just shooting guns. Aim at the head if you want, it does more damage. Enemy AI is stupid, even on the highest difficulty; they mostly just run into a room and stand there shooting, no tactics required. Castillo's most formidable soldiers can be easily one-shot, and his armored tanks and aircraft are at most two rockets away from destruction. There's really nothing to say about the gameplay. It's the exact same as every previous Far Cry game.\n\nDesign-wise, a lot of the UI is baffling.[list]\n[*]There is a loadout system where you can set up to 4 favorite sets of equipment for different tasks, but there are no hotkeys to swap to those loadouts, so you always have to open menu, select loadout, then select the specific one. \n[*]The field of view is so awful it's unbelievable. Even with mods, the FOV in vehicles is pathetically narrow. Driving anything feels like you're starting into binoculars.\n[*]You're always wearing an enormous, ugly backpack. Mods can visually remove it, but it's visible every time you see your customized character if you don't chose to do that.\n[*]Hilariously, the highest difficulty removes the ability to see where another human player is in co-op. This doesn't make anything harder, because you're still two people who can talk to each other, but it does make it feel like you're playing the game alone. Not exactly how you want the co-op experience to feel.\n[*]I hope you're ready to turn off the radio every time you get into any vehicle, because it defaults to on and blasts over all other game sound.[/list]\nThere are other design issues as well, like being able to airdrop literally anywhere, obviating the need to drive entirely. You can always efficively bypass any anti-aircraft defenses by flying into a region and jumping out of an aircraft before it's destroyed to land directly on AA guns and destroy them without effort. There are also pieces of gear you can unlock that refund any headshot bullet back into your gun, but not into the magazine, ready to reload: they refund directly into the chamber, turning the slowest, strongest sniper rifle in the game into a semi-automatic murder machine if you can shoot even half-way decently.\n\nThere are more quibbles, but this is enough of an overview. All told, Far Cry 6 is like its predecessors in all the wrong ways and is a posterchild for bland and bloated modern committee-made game design. It looks great, but it's stuffed to the gills with worthless, repetitive activities and collectables to make you think that you're doing something interesting while you're actually just wasting time. The story is bad, the villain is fine, the player character is unmotivated, the supporting cast in horrendous. And, cherry on top, Ubisoft is so angry that no one wants to use their launcher they withheld achievements from Steam. Hilarious. Skip this game.\n\nOh, and the DLC is three horrendously designed roguelikes built on systems that don't support that kind of play.",

        "review": "Far cry 6 is... interesting, not from a story or game-play perspective. From a game design perspective, the more you play you start to notice how the game was originally supposed to be due to how things are laid out and designed. You can tell the game had a lot of workplace intrigue and politics interfere with the development process. \n\nThe world looks beautiful, its filled with military bases, camps, government buildings, outposts, fortresses, naval yards, air bases, checkpoints all over, yet it deceives the player into thinking you can take them over like in other far cry games when you view the map. You see a lot of restricted zones on the map yet only specific areas are take overs. Many of these locations with how they are designed, may of originally supposed to be outposts that the player can take over like in previous games, hell they even have voice lines when you get close to them like the military bases marked in the game. Anti air sites look like you were originally supposed to be given the option to hack into them instead of blowing them up to clear the airspace due to how each and every site has a laptop set up near depleted uranium chests. There are even areas that are restricted zones yet hold no strategic value, you can tell they are not even finished, yet still exist as if it was supposed to a part of something bigger or tied to a mission that got axed. \n\nThe narrative is interesting, you can tell they are all written by different people, all had a different view on how the game should unfold and its direction. You can tell which characters were just added in later to fill a quota due to how insufferable they were written. The characters you may like, they look like they are written into the game with them in mind, yet their role they were supposed to have in the plot got axed/diminished. The top region's storyline is the most far cry like narrative you can get in this game, and it's even the region the game recommends you start first as if they devs knew the other storylines were garbage. The middle region's storyline is pretty much filling out checkboxes, the bottom region's story looks to have been interfered with a lot, it started out fine then took a turn for the worst.\n\nThey brought back the billions of collectibles again that add nothing of value to the game, its weird since half of them are tied to like a base take over while many of them are just placed around the map in the middle of nowhere, places you never have a reason visit those areas at all which brings up the point of how they used to be part of a take over since all takeovers have a treasure room, each with a collectible inside them.\n\nThe game is a big disappointment if you took notice like I did. People say its the same far cry formula, no its not. The game plays worse in every shape and form, its a downgrade to what we got before. The AI is hot garbage, I mean really bad. If you thought the ai was bad in the older titles, well you are in for a treat. The AI is really bad, it in turn makes the stealth look really bad, despite it being exactly the same in the other games except the ai is deaf, blind, and braindead methheads. \n\nThe balancing is pretty bad. It uses a very gamey rock paper scissors system, ap round for armored enemies. soft target rounds for unarmored, explosive for vehicles poison and incendiary are damage over time. You can't even switch out ammo types on the fly you are locked in with that gun until you use a workbench. Most people just use AP since enemies are mostly armored up then not. Can't we just have a more realistic system instead of this garbage. You know like watching bullets bouncing off metal armor like we saw in far cry 3 to indicate he was very well armored in that area, or in far cry 4 seeing bullets getting absorbed by their flak jackets telling the player that spot is protected. player didn't need gamer vision smart phones to visually see how well equipped enemies are and where their exposed points are, we didn't have ammo types back then too.\n\nAll in all, this game is a big disappointment and unfortunately isn't as fun as the previous titles due to its share of problems that shouldn't of existed in the first place, they just reinvented systems that weren't broken instead building upon and improving what we had before.",

[/h3]\n\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n\nShoot 'em all, grind 'em up, startegic, there's something for everyone, and everyone can play to their heart's content or preference.\nThe gunfighting is very good, and respects the Farcry atmosphere.\nCompanions are a part of the game that I really enjoyed, original and hardcore, I love it.\nThe biggest positive in farcry is conquer areas on the map, this style of RPG is always my favorite but even that they missed, the zone and before postent seems catchable but not on the duration.\nUnfortunately, for me, this game marks the end of farcty, go woke, go broke.\nEven if the woke ideology, always at the antipodes of reality, isn't ultra-present in this game, it's already too much.\nLooks like to just cause, but will never be able to match just cause again.\n\n[h1] Graphic design: [/h1]\nIt's pretty, the map is detailed, the graphics aren't the best, but considering the mix between map size, animations and life on the map, the graphics are very respectable, but graphics are unfortunately the only thing that remains respectable at Ubisoft.\n\n[h1] Playtime: [/h1]\nThe story is boring, kid ideology, once the map is controlled and the story finished, spending more time on this game is impossible.\n\n[h1] Price: [/h1]\nMuch too expensive, wait for the sales.\n\n[h3] It's a good game, the gunfigth is good. But we can no longer trust Ubisoft. No recommender. [/h3]\n\n[h1] If you like RPG games and Adventures Games, come and discover what's available on steam.

        "review": "This is not a game. This is a semi-interactive movie. The gameplay is pretty easy on story mode. You can basically run through enemies, or run away from them. The main storyline has potential, but it doesn't have compelling characters to support it. The NPCs, even the \"important\" ones, are boring, generic, and uninteresting. Those that die in the course of the story leave you not caring at all.\r\n\r\nThe world is visually beautiful, except that it's choppy and laggy. The audio cuts in and out. My computer is pretty powerful, but I still had to turn graphics settings down in order to actually play without getting so frustrated that I had to turn it off. There's a lot to do in the open world, plenty of side quests, though none of which I really cared to pursue. They just seemed boring. You can hunt and fish in order to get resources, and there are a lot of resources to collect. You don't really need to go out of your way to get them, though, because the game gives you everything you need to beat it as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIf you're the kind of person who finds political undertones in your games annoying, this one has its share. It also has focused on diversity in its characters over their substance or building interest in them. If you're the kind of person who likes representation in your games, this game is full of \"strong female characters,\" a trans character, and so forth. Again, in my opinion the main failing of these characters is that the story and the game doesn't flesh them out or make them interesting. The extent to which it builds these characters is, \"So-and-so likes to spray paint,\" or, \"Such-and-such is crazy and has a dead brother who they miss.\"\r\n\r\nThere are much, much better games out there. If you're really bored and want to run around aimlessly and shoot easy targets, or you want to hear the world's worst Spanish rap song, pick it up. But don't say you weren't warned.",

DEFINITELY get at a good deal!!!\r\nOverall: I do enjoy the game and it does sometimes feel a bit lackluster in some areas however it is still a good game 6/10\r\n",

The gameplay and side content has been improved, with far more variety and complexity added to the regular Far Cry formula, and the open world is absolutely massive, but the series has lost some of its character with the transition to 3rd person cutscenes, and it doesn't make good enough use of its best asset, its story and villians. Even with the change to third person cutscenes and the ability to view the villians in contexts outside interactions with the main character, you rarely spend time with any of the villians. \n\nThe trailers also incorrectly marketed the open world of this game. From the outside, it may seem like this game has a large city section, but Esperanza, this game's version of Havana, is very small and not very interesting. The vast majority of your time will be spent in the more rural locations we're used to for the Far Cry series. It's a shame there wasn't a large city portion, as Havana is one of the most interesting cities in the world, and the architecture that is there is amazing. \n\nOverall, Far Cry 6 is a fun experience, but one that I think could've been better. \n\n7/10",

        "review": "It's with a heavy heart that I have to give this game a mixed review. Even after heavily modding its gameplay to fix what I regard as its prime gameplay flaws, I came away from my playthrough less than happy with the results.\n\nFar Cry 6 takes most of the things I thought worked really well in Far Cry 5- the snappy, somewhat-realistic hero-shooter combat, intriguing villains that drove the story, and beautiful graphical presentation- and returns with a game that's just not the sum of its parts.\n\nWhere I feel this game clearly failed to work:\n\n1. Shooter mechanics that drove players to constantly upgrade to new guns that felt a lot like the old guns, rather than have interesting new mechanics, because enemies rapidly became bullet sponges. After modding the weapon damages sky-high, so that all of the guns felt fairly realistic in their behaviors (i.e., lowering Time To Kill quite considerably across the board- the mod I used did not allow individual weapons to be tweaked to achieve more interesting re-balance, unfortunately) gameplay felt OK, but it lacked the interest of Far Cry 5, where I felt like the weapons had a lot more nuance.\n\n2. What on earth went wrong with the bow? One of the primary weapons in the series, the bow weapons were, up until the unfortunate mess that was Far Cry: New Dawn, balanced as quirky, hard-to-master stealth weapons that killed pretty much any human enemy in the game, but required much more skill to use because of the long lead times and arrow drop physics. In this game, I found the bow almost unusable; it simply didn't work correctly for the game design and wasn't implemented with the care that it required.\n\n3. Vehicles were a hugely wasted mechanic. There's a \"hero car\" you're supposed to invest lots of time and resources into that instead felt like a complete waste of time. Traversal of the island's difficult, narrow roadways through mountainous terrains meant that using ground travel of any kind was always the slow way to get anywhere. Players were immediately pushed to instead use the \"resolver\" flying-pontoon-drone thing, which was obviously stuck into the design as a small, easy-to-pilot system, but it didn't have any upgrade path to make it more useful and interesting. Such a huge amount of development time and effort were spent on horses, ground vehicles, other helicopters that weren't nearly as useful because they needed giant cleared spaces to land, etc.\n\n4. Characters I largely disliked, driving a narrative that didn't quite gel for me. Whether we're talking about Paolo's endless whining about how his \"revolution hasn't even started yet\" or the decision to abruptly kill off my two favorite characters, to the strange disinclination of the game to make the few-and-far-between fights with a supposedly-hardcore buddy feel good (seriously, they just stand around, kill nobody and you just lead them around on missions) was a really strange creative decision.\n\n5. The ending felt hollow and totally bereft of meaningful choices.\n\n6. Your main character is an awesome, smart person... except when he / she needs to suddenly get taken down for plot reasons. Other characters get unusual levels of Plot Armor. \n\n7. The three principal baddies you're supposed to hate and take down lack much charisma and their final boss-fights felt dull compared to Far Cry 5's masterful buildup and storytelling.\n\n8. Brain-dead auto-driving AI when you're forced to use a ground vehicle in missions.\n\n9. Vehicle weapons felt like shooting nerf darts.\n\n10. I know that some players probably really loved the animal companions, but I just found them obnoxious and left them at my base. I wanted to love them, but even the deliberately-cute Chorizo felt less useful than gimmicky, and the more combat-oriented buddies just removed all of the stealth aspects that typically make Far Cry games fun.\n\n11. The core game ran out of new content to unlock surprisingly quickly, and most of the gear that was locked behind quests or was in secret areas was disappointingly downgrades from anything you already owned. This wasn't always the case, but for example when you finally unlock the ARC-C rifle, it's rubbish compared to what you already have.\n\n12. Most of the Resolver weapons are trash, in terms of power balance and usefulness, which left me rather confused- these are supposed to be the cool unique weapons Raul cooked up, not stuff we try one time and then never use again. \n\nThere are exactly two that are OK outside of a few missions- the multiple rocket launcher that magically does more damage with fireworks than anything else in the game, even modern anti-tank weapons, and the flamethrower, which was occasionally useful for making the enemy AI get really confused. The rest felt like wasted opportunities and should have been buffed considerably during internal review.\n\n\n\n\nAll that said... I hate to write this negative review and not give the game credit where it's due. If you've gotten this far, here are things I liked:\n\n1. The graphics are, despite some big issues with pop-in, even with distances set to maximum levels on a fairly-powerful PC, pretty gorgeous in places. Dunia Engine is impressive technology.\n\n2. Strong voice performances by all of the actors and actresses involved. Even when I didn't like how they were written, they were clearly doing their best.\n\n3. Good animation quality for cutscenes.\n\n4. While many things were directly lifted from Far Cry 5 (blowing up barrels full of Bliss- er, I mean Invivio, etc.) most of these things worked all right.\n\n5. Taking down checkpoints and military bases was just fine, once I fixed the glaring issues with the gameplay's core feel with modding.\n\n6. Fishing was actually better than in Far Cry 5. It was such an unimportant side activity, but it felt better and if you played this title unmodded and were scraping for resources all the time, I could see it being a nice way to cadge resources.\n\n\n\nSo... could this game be fixed? Sure thing, and if it wasn't such a pain to mod, I'd have been sorely tempted to get my hands dirty and fix as much as possible, starting with the poor weapons design choices and the sponge-like combat mechanics. \n\nPerhaps, Ubisoft, if you're reading this.... it's time to figure out how to expose most of the game's core variables and systems via Lua, so that your games can get extensively modded post-release by end-users, rather than treating your games as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition being modded by a handful of dedicated nerds who don't mind sifting through your proprietary compression format and even using hex-editing applications looking for the data they need to alter.\n\nI'm guessing that, if you're actually reading this, upper management will tell you \"why bother, it's a lot of work and we don't care about modding\", etc., but you can reply that... if they look at their stock price, and review the data on, say, the remarkable sales tail on games like Skyrim... they're just leaving massive amounts of money on the table and it's time to finally address this by making Dunia Engine games much more accessible to modders to fix up post-release, rather than continuing to pretend it's not a real problem.",

Especially interactions with the villains. It was extremely immersive.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gameplay between scenes is quintessential Far Cry. The firefights, the weapons, the slight ridiculousness in weapons and fighting. The actual gameplay is ALL Far Cry.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to hate this game after the first non immersive scene. It really made me angry, to see one of my favourite series ruined in that way. But when I kept playing, it really felt like Far Cry. Both the story and the gameplay are absolutely amazing.

NPC's mill around existing, animals exist but are nothing like earlier entries where they hunted each other adding to the world building. Nothing feels like a revolution in this game with bases looked after by 5 npcs or less and the world barely changing as you progress. \r\n\r\nI would say that this is an incredibly formulaic Ubisoft game. Mechanics haven't evolved since early Far Cry games and you still have the exact same gameplay loop from the past 10-15 years of Ubisoft games. I've come to expect terrible endings in Farr Cry games where they seem to want to make a statement rather than tie it up nicely and this one is terrible as expected. Outside of the beautiful world and gunplay it's an incredibly bland game full of irritating characters, a slightly disjointed story, a dead sandbox and stripped down mechanics such as the removal of skills. \r\n\r\nI hope Ubisoft reassess for Far Cry 7 but that remains to be seen.",

        "review": "Far Cry 6: A Chaotic Revolution in Paradise\r\n\r\n\"Far Cry 6,\" developed by Ubisoft, returns to the series' roots with a new and ambitious take on open-world chaos. Set in the beautiful yet brutal fictional Caribbean island of Yara, the game immerses you in a high-stakes revolution against a ruthless dictator. With a sprawling open world, diverse gameplay mechanics, and a compelling cast of characters, \"Far Cry 6\" delivers an action-packed experience that is both familiar and fresh.\r\n\r\nA Rich, Explosive Setting\r\nYara is, without a doubt, the most vivid and expansive setting in the Far Cry series to date. Inspired by Cuba, Yara offers a visually stunning backdrop of lush jungles, urban streets, serene beaches, and mountain ranges, all filled with striking colors and rich textures. The attention to detail in the world-building is incredible, from the political propaganda plastered on crumbling buildings to the lively streets filled with everyday citizens going about their lives under oppressive rule.\r\n\r\nThe island feels alive with a unique sense of culture and history, with a constant undercurrent of rebellion. You\u2019ll see townsfolk whispering about resistance movements, soldiers patrolling with an iron fist, and rebels setting up makeshift camps. This dynamic environment, paired with a gorgeous day-night cycle and weather effects, makes exploring Yara a visual and emotional delight.\r\n\r\nStory and Characters: A Charismatic Revolution\r\nAt the heart of \"Far Cry 6\" is a story of revolution, and it\u2019s led by a cast of compelling characters. You play as Dani Rojas, a reluctant guerrilla fighter caught in the middle of the uprising against the dictatorial regime of Anton Castillo, played brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito. Castillo is one of the series\u2019 most memorable villains\u2014a charismatic yet ruthless leader who will stop at nothing to impose his vision on Yara, grooming his son Diego to follow in his footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe narrative strikes a balance between intense drama and the series' signature dark humor. The characters you meet along the way\u2014eccentric rebels, shady smugglers, and brave citizens\u2014add a rich tapestry of stories that draw you deeper into Yara\u2019s revolution. The game's writing is sharp, often poignant, and sometimes even surprisingly heartfelt, offering moments that feel genuinely impactful.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Freedom and Ferocity\r\n\"Far Cry 6\" retains the core gameplay mechanics that fans love: a mix of stealth, exploration, and over-the-top action. But it also introduces new elements that add depth and variety. The addition of the \"Resolver\" weapons\u2014makeshift armaments crafted from scrap materials\u2014encourages creativity in combat. From a sardine can launcher to a CD-shooting gun that blasts \"Macarena\" while you mow down enemies, these weapons are as fun as they are functional, bringing a fresh flavor to the firefights.\r\n\r\nThe \"Amigos\" system allows you to recruit animal companions, each with unique abilities. Whether it\u2019s Chorizo, the adorable dachshund who distracts enemies, or Guapo, a battle-hardened crocodile, these allies add both humor and strategy to your approach. Additionally, the ability to switch between different types of ammo and customize gear makes for a more personalized playstyle, allowing players to adapt to various situations on the fly.\r\n\r\nA World of Activities and Exploration\r\nYara is packed with activities beyond the main story. You can hunt for rare animals, search for hidden treasures, sabotage enemy installations, or take part in guerrilla operations with fellow revolutionaries. The game\u2019s world is filled with collectibles, secrets, and side missions that range from the ridiculous to the profoundly moving. The sheer volume of things to do makes it easy to get lost in the world, with something new always around the corner.\r\n\r\nVehicles, from horses to tanks, are plentiful, and the ability to customize them ensures that getting from point A to B is always an adventure. Whether you\u2019re speeding through enemy checkpoints in a customized muscle car or soaring through the skies in a homemade helicopter, every mode of travel feels unique and fun.\r\n\r\nCo-op and Replayability: An Open Invitation to Chaos\r\n\"Far Cry 6\" shines brightest when played with a friend. The drop-in/drop-out co-op mode allows you to team up and take on missions together, creating endless opportunities for hilarious and chaotic moments. The world feels even more dynamic when shared, and the variety of approaches you can take with a partner ensures no two missions feel the same.\r\n\r\nWith multiple difficulty settings, the vast range of weapons and vehicles, and a large map filled with secrets, \"Far Cry 6\" offers plenty of reasons to revisit Yara long after the credits roll.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict\r\n\"Far Cry 6\" delivers a robust open-world experience that captures the thrill of rebellion and the beauty of a country in turmoil. It stays true to the series' roots while introducing enough new elements to keep things fresh and engaging. While it doesn\u2019t completely reinvent the formula, it\u2019s an immensely satisfying adventure filled with memorable characters, explosive gameplay, and a world that begs to be explored.\r\n\r\nRating: 8.5/10\r\n\r\n\"Far Cry 6\" is a love letter to fans of the series, offering everything you\u2019d want in an open-world shooter and more. It\u2019s a vibrant, chaotic playground that lets you craft your own story of revolution, and it\u2019s a journey well worth taking.",

The plot and gameplay is a little cliche and redundant when you think of it against other games, but hey I only got it because of Gustavo Fring. I\u2019m not done with the game in the slightest, but it\u2019s a shame Anton (Gus) just disappears after the opening segments, and we just hear repetitive voice lines of him instead. Hopefully we see him again in the final act.",

        "review": "Best coop, but probably the weakest main villain of any Far Cry game post-Far Cry 3. Don't get me wrong, Giancarlo Esposito is certainly sufficiently menacing as Anton Castillo, but all the villains (both major and minor) of Far Cry 6 suffers from one or both of two things: build up and distance. \n\nMost of the minor villains lack sufficient build up to feel meaningful. As for Anton Castillo, I don't think the game has you interact with him enough, on a personal level, for him to really hit on the level of Vaas, Pagan Min, or Joseph Seed. \n\nHaving said that: it was still an extremely fun time in coop. The coop is also better balanced, is the same that character progression works fine even in coop (in prior games, you wouldn't unlock major character upgrades in coop as the guest). \n\nThe world is also gorgeous and extensive, with a variety of locations and environments across the archipelago of Yara. There's a ton of fun guns to shoot, and good vehicle variety. \n\n",

Also the dialogues were funny at first but then got very idiotic fast later where in the other hand the bad guy had the best screen time and dialogues starring Esposito.( who always kills it)\nMeanwhile you are talking to this guy or girl who tells you to go 2500m to do this, and come back to go another 2000m to do that ...\nOther than this, graphics were cool.\n\nConclusion : if you're that bored to play anything and brain dead AND the game is on sale ...

        "review": "The setting of fighting a Latin american dictatorship was perfect. They just had to screw it up with the awful changes in mechanics.\n-You have to keep changing ammo types for different enemies. Enemies are bullet sponges if you use the wrong ammo. Example: 5 body shots with .50 sniper rounds is required to take down enemies wearing dress uniform if you use the wrong ammo type ie. armour piercing, explosive or standard rounds. It has to be soft target round for enemies not wearing any armour at all. \n-Clothing set up (for different perks) also has to be constantly changed, and tediously via the menu. \n-There are no human companions\n-They also removed manual saves so I often lose couple minutes of progress each time I resume the game, and not knowing what happened the last time I played\n-The capital city is a ghost town without any civilians. Can't even fly there.\nI'm sure I'd have more gripes against the game design elements I have yet to pick up on but I'm struggling to continue have fun playing after 12ish hours.\nBig step back for the series.\n",

        "review": "Too long of a game that gets bland and repetitive. I like long games, but this one felt like it was made long for the sake of being long.\nThere's too much but it's poorly executed half the time. Too many weapons but I never touched most of them because you can only equip 3 and a sidearm, Yet you can have all of the weapons with you, but to change them you need to open a menu, navigate the silly amount of guns and try to find the one you want, then chose it and exit again. This led me to not even trying all of the special unique weapons the game has because it's too tedious. Same goes for clothes/armor. It all feels like a lot of directionless effort. The game is also so glitchy even though it's over a year since release, at times leading to having to reload the game because some glitch wouldn't allow progress because an NPC got stuck in a wall or something silly like that.\n\nI don't mind a repetitive Far Cry formula, but this one was poorly executed and even though I finished it, half the time I couldn't tell if I was having that much fun.\n\nWould only recomment if on steep sale.",

With that said, I'll post my pros and cons, then why.\n\nPros:\n1. Cast\n2. graphics\n3. caves/stashes\n4. weapon customization\n5. Horses\n6. Supremos.\n\nCons:\n1. ammo types\n2. aircraft controls\n3. various story aspects\n4. amigos\n5. appearance/clothes\n6. 3rd person areas\n7. enemy AI\n8. doesn't feel like a Far Cry game\n\nThe ammo types were a real bad thing they added in this, I beat this game with an unsilenced pistol, after I shot a dude with an explosive arrow and he just brushed it off. In the previous games he would of been paint on the wall. The poison wasn't much of a threat in this game, I saw it like the Bliss in FC5, wasn't a big deal. I could forgive the ammo types a little since the enemy AI are all near sighted, and hard of hearing. I ran through checkpoints, repaired my car, and kept going, than decided to just walk back in, headshot everything, and lob a nade at the billboard. The cast is amazing, and Giancarlo Esposito is a legend and was half the marketing to get people to buy this game, however Anton has no relationship with Dani, Vaas messed with Jason Brody, and came to respectfully despise him. Pagan Min, didn't even try to stop Ajay, and even let him spread his mothers ashes afterward. Joseph and his family interacted with The Rookie through the whole game. Anton only showed up in a few cut scenes, and only saw Dani 3 times in the whole game.\n\nMy final thoughts are, get it on sale, spend a fun weekend then go back to your favorite Far Cry game.",

In fact, there is so much to do that the game runs out of meaningful rewards to give you for those tasks. You are expected to keep doing the the things for completionist sake and nothing else. The game is bloated with so many empty calories it's actually incredible.\r\n\r\nThe world is pretty and big but it's busting at the seams with checklist bs that rewards nothing meaningful after a certain point.\r\n\r\nThe story is poor this time around but ends decently strong. The big story and action setpeices are pretty pretty bad in this one though. It really is lacking flavor compared to the stronger entries in the series like 3 and 4. \r\n\r\nFarcry in general never excelled as a \"go loud\" shooter. The strength of the gameplay and gunplay was always the sneaky stealth aspects. This game forces you into more \"go loud\" situations than previous games during story missions, and, in the process, tries to force you to engage with the worst change in the series to date, the gear system.\r\n\r\nThe gear/loadout system is trash. It unfortunately replaced the skill trees and leveling up, instead gating more and more \"\"\"powerful\"\"\" gear which you can either find in crates or buy behind ranks. The game wants you to make multiple loadouts for different situations, combining this with the supremos (which I don't really have an issue with, I just used the jetpack one the whole game). I guess this could be fun, but you can totally build a loadout you like and set and forget it for 90% of the game. The rub is when an enemy basically 1 hits you because you weren't wearing gear to protect from that damage type. It leads to a lot of WTF moments.\r\n\r\n37 hours and I beat the game, got all the weapons, did all the treasures, and completed basically everything I wanted to. \r\n\r\nGet it on sale if you like the farcry gameplay loop. For sure don't play this one as your first one. Play farcry 3 with ziggys mod installed. \r\n",

This will force you to restart the game or even sometimes your pc every 2 hours or so.\r\n\r\nHow did I fix it?\r\n\r\nWe'll its not really a fix, more of a work around and it kinda sucks but its playable.\r\n\r\nSo Im running a Ryzen 7 5800X and a RX 6600 XT 8GB at 1440P 165HZ\r\n\r\nAnd Im suppose to play the game at ultra no problem, but my game would run great at 80plus fps and then after about 2 hours the game would drop frames like crazy and my vram usage would spike as well.\r\n\r\nSo, I turned down the refresh rate from 165hz to 120hz and from Ultra to High (at native 1440p) NO FIDELITY FX\r\n\r\nI also capped my FPS at 75fps,\r\n\r\nAnd this actually fixed my issue, I can now play the game like normal with no issues and no frame drops.\r\n\r\nUnless, you use your menu to frequently, then the game would just break and you would have to restart.\r\n\r\nSo overall, Im managing to play it quite effortlessly now but I would highly suggest you just get the game on Epic or Xbox game pass, the install file is smaller there and my friend who is playing it on xbox is not experiencing the same issues I am.\r\n\r\nIm a massive steam fan, but this game is broken on steam.",

Never played 1 or 2 and I kinda hate 4. I love 3, 5, ND and Primal. At first I didn't care for this one. The combat was clunky and I died constantly. Then I got a better weapon, and I got a upgrade to move faster and bit by bit it started to feel like Far Cry again. So yes I would recommend. But with the stipulation that you might have to sink some time in to really see what it has to offer as far an entry in the series goes. But who knows it might go of a cliff- I haven't played it that long yet.",

The level design favors keeping you on guided paths, there's not much interesting to explore.\n\nThere's no tower climbing, but every other tired Ubisoft mechanic is present in the gameplay: Scout the location, Stealth the dumb AI, go dynamic in a pinch, capture the flag and move in friendlies, rinse and repeat for the next 25 hours.

        "review": "As a long-time fan of the Far Cry series, I had high hopes for Far Cry 6, but unfortunately, it left me more frustrated than entertained. While the game had the potential to be another blockbuster in the series, it ultimately fails to live up to its predecessors in several key areas.\r\n\r\nRepetitive Gameplay:\r\nThe most glaring issue with Far Cry 6 is the repetitive nature of its gameplay. After the initial excitement of exploring a new open world and engaging in guerrilla warfare, the missions quickly become monotonous. The game essentially boils down to a rinse-and-repeat cycle of capturing outposts, destroying anti-aircraft sites, and completing fetch quests. There\u2019s little innovation or variation in mission design, making the game feel like a chore rather than an adventure.\r\n\r\nUnderwhelming Storyline:\r\nOne of the series\u2019 strengths has always been its compelling villains, but Anton Castillo, portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito, is disappointingly underutilized. The story lacks depth and fails to engage on an emotional level. The protagonist, Dani Rojas, is also bland, with dialogue that feels forced and lacks the charisma needed to carry the narrative. The moral complexity that previous games offered is missing here, leaving a generic and predictable plot.\r\n\r\nTechnical Issues:\r\nFar Cry 6 is plagued by technical problems that severely hamper the experience. The game suffers from frequent bugs and glitches, including enemies that disappear, missions that don\u2019t trigger properly, and frustratingly long load times. These issues break immersion and make the game feel unfinished. Even on higher-end systems, performance can be inconsistent, with frame drops and stuttering during intense sequences.\r\n\r\nLack of Innovation:\r\nFor a game that is part of a well-established series, Far Cry 6 brings very little new to the table. The formula feels stale, and the game seems content to recycle elements from previous entries without adding anything truly fresh or exciting. The crafting system is cumbersome, and the inclusion of Resolver weapons, while initially intriguing, quickly loses its novelty.\r\n\r\nTedious Collectibles and Side Content:\r\nThe game is bloated with unnecessary collectibles and side activities that feel like padding rather than meaningful content. Chasing after roosters, hunting mythical animals, or collecting USB sticks doesn\u2019t add much to the overall experience and often feels like busywork. These side quests are neither engaging nor rewarding enough to justify the time spent on them.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nFar Cry 6 is a disappointing entry in a franchise that once set the standard for open-world shooters. It struggles with repetitive gameplay, a lackluster story, and technical issues that detract from the overall experience. While it may offer some moments of fun, especially for newcomers to the series, it fails to capture the magic that made its predecessors so beloved. For long-time fans, this installment might feel more like a step backward than a step forward.",

        "review": "I think I've played enough now to form a valid opinion. I've played all of the Far cry titles, this is my first on PC. So to start -  I was hesitant to buy the game based on the mixed reviews, but after reading through the negative, I came to find a strong majority of reviewers are either A) stuck in 2012 up Vaas' rear end, or B) cannot adapt to fresh gameplay.\r\n\r\nFirst lets look at the antagonist, Castillo; no, he isn't a crazy pirate or leader of a wild cult.. but it wouldn't make sense for him to be a lunatic, he's an evil dictator and the part is portrayed very well, he's more \"calculated\" in his behaviours, not our average Far cry bad guy, but he's one you'll find yourself wanting to hunt down.. if you're not expecting said crazy pirate.\r\n\r\nNext, what I mentioned about adaptation; the game doesn't have a skill tree, your skills are based on the clothing you find and wear, I've noticed there are bad reviews based on this alone and it just doesn't make sense, is it not nice to have a fresh take every now and then?\r\n\r\nThis is a Far cry game and you'll know it whilst playing it, there is still the huge open world with plenty of bases to take over, and plenty of other collectables and goodies to hunt down! don't let the bad reviews put you off!\r\n\r\nThe protagonist Dani has quite a bit of character depth, and all the main characters you encounter have very strong personalities, the only issue I would have is the series seems to take a bit of a \"woke\" turn here, I won't get political, i'll let you play the game and see what I mean.\r\n\r\nThere's a cockerel fighting mini game based on the likes of Mortal Kombat or Streetfighter, its hilarious!\r\n\r\nbesides the usual problems playing a ubisoft game through steam, 10/10\r\n\r\nnow if you'll excuse me, I have some more soldados to hunt down...",
