        "review": "Now, bear in mind: I got this game dirt cheap. Right off the bat, my first piece of advice to you is not to get it for full price. Maybe when it's off by 50% or more. Because when \"Gotham Knights\" is fairly priced, it's honestly quite an enjoyable time. Oh, and yes: you can play the entire game solo. \r\n\r\nNow, full disclosure: I love the Batman Arkham games and Red Hood is one of my favorite DC characters, so that certainly helped me get over some of the glaring flaws in this title. But I won't shy away from admitting that those exist and are quite annoying at times. Even with that, though, when Gotham Knights works it becomes really fun. \r\n\r\nIs it more fun than any of the Arkham games that came before it? No. Not by a long shot. And I'm one of the guys that thinks that \"Arkham Knight\" is underrated, so you can imagine.\r\n\r\nOkay, then, let's start with the good. The art direction in this game is fantastic. We've got good ol' gloomy Gotham, but bathed in neon, which is a great idea, honestly. Then we've got the main cast: great character designs and awesome costumes. Voice acting is great, but the writing really, really brings it down. I'll phrase it like this: have you watched \"Arrow\"? Do you know how that show is sometimes written in a turbo-cringe way, but it remains enjoyable because it is charming? Well, here it's the same, but without any of the charm. You've got the whole schtick: from forced inclusivity all the way to self-serving plot elements. \r\n\r\nOther than that, though, the story itself -- as an idea -- is great. It's not executed in the best of ways, sure, and any one among you that has been a Batman fan for at least five minutes would see where it's going about 4 hours in, but hey: I appreciate the effort. The important thing is that the game is fun to play. I mean, sometimes.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, here's the problems: characters get stuck on everything. Moves don't connect properly. Abilities sometimes trigger, other times don't, and then sometimes they also miss entirely. Heavy attacks with some characters are utterly pointless. City navigation, with some characters, is incredibly dull and boring. Figuring out what to do, sometimes, is exceptionally difficult. And, of course, the very fact that this game was built multiplayer-first is an issue to the extent where I absolutely wish it was not. \r\n\r\nOh, and textures fail to load-in properly half the time, which results in a mix of HD and SD content that looks, well\u2026 Unique. \r\n\r\nSo, have you played any of the Arkham games? You know how you feel in total control of Batman? Well, here it's not the case. In fact, far from it. When it works, it feels like a broken Arkham game, when it does not: it's a pain. But something in my broken brain was okay with that. Whether it was because I like the games that came before this one or due to the core gameplay loop being fun: I honestly cannot be sure. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot to do in this game. Levelling up and unlocking gear is fun. The provided skill trees are utterly pointless, so you'll probably forget that they even exist. The very idea of a progression system, however, carries that extra bit of satisfaction. Unfortunately, there is content locked behind levels and gear requirements and I just didn't partake in any of it. \r\n\r\n\"Gotham Knights\" isn't a bad idea, but it's a bad execution. If it was built like a proper Arkham game from the ground up, I have no doubt in my mind that it would've been a ton more fun. That being said: it is still a good time for Batman nerds and Arkham fans. If anything, this title proves that there is certainly an  audience for spinoff Arkham games. So long as they are single-player and their content isn't locked behind a poorly designed progression system. \r\n\r\nOn a personal level, I think that Red Hood\u2019s campaign here does the character service. And that\u2019s a tough thing to do, considering what DC has done to Jason in the past. He\u2019s not always written well, but ultimately he gets a nice, neat character ark that just feels proper after the events of \u201cArkham Knight\u201d.",

        "review": "It's a hollow product that should have stayed in the oven for at least two more years - I went into the game knowing full well it was bad, still I was surprised in both good and bad ways. \r\n\r\nLet's start with the good things: amazing aesthetic of city design, good looking suits and touching side story sequences. The design team did their job wonderfully and gave us a Gotham design that's almost on par with Arkham Knight's Gotham. Still it lacks substance - the staggering absence of details around the city, and the unvaried building structures.\r\n\r\nThe real downsides of Gotham Knights are many, namely the horrendous gameplay, bad story progression, uncreative and repetitive side activities, etc. Its combat takes away all the things that made Batman Arkham games great, and gives us a jankier Sleeping Dogs. Sometimes it's required to do Ubisoft-styled missions in order to progress story, meaning you have to find \"clues\" or interrogate thugs through random events. The story progression system is truly evolving backwards. The batcycle is slow AF, the game has to add a wind blowing filter to make it look fast lol. There're also a tons of what I consider to be minor issues, like NPCs repeat lines way too often, NPC models vanish soon as enter a camera blind spot.\r\n\r\nAll those I can still endure. But my current biggest gripe with it is the the genuinely unfun experience resulting from a combination of widely scattered side activities and severely downgraded (from the Batman Arkham games) traversal system. Gliding and grappling speed is somewhere between Arkham City and Knight, but the traversal as a whole feels wrong on many level - there's no physics or a good sense of control to it. And the lack of detail in Gotham only makes going around the map even worse. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - the design dev team is 9/10 but the gameplay dev team is 5/10",

        "review": "[h1]Superheroes in training[/h1]\n\nAn experience that might be enjoyable with a coop partner, but not worth it if you are going solo.\n\nRepetitiveness is the keyword. There are many activities or \"patrols\" as they call them, to gain levels and grind materials for equipment crafting. They all turn out pretty much samey, in that it all ends in an all out brawl, pummeling enemies that feel like punchbags, soaking a lot of damage. Yet these patrols are short and way too simplistic in design. More handcrafted experiences would've been nice. It felt like a copy-paste each night.\n\nWithout knowing the actual intent of the designers, it felt like one of those MMORPGs that has daily quests, battlepasses and artificially increasing the length of the game by making the materials scarce and random, all with uninspired, monotonous gameplay.\n\nAlthough with a coop partner all that grinding would be less annoying. I was joined by a random person online, and it was nice playing with someone. It made fighting a lot more easier, but like other coop games, it would shine if it were someone you knew or had the courage to talk online, coordinating attacks, strategies and overall hanging out as vigilantes, I guess. I'm just a very socially awkward introvert.\n\nThere are many things that I don't like in this game, for example, the speed is super weird. It is slow; the bike moves slowly through the city, yet there are effects layered on that should make it look faster, and that confuses my brain. The characters movement is lighter, yet heavy at the same time. I don't feel like they hit the right notes there. It is weird, because they already found the secret sauce in the Arkham Trilogy, in which Batman, and also the other characters, Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and I think there were more, but can't remember, they felt solid, yet agile enough to feel good to control.\n\nAnother thing that got in my nerves, especially because combat is such a big thing and you do it so often, the camera just doesn't work. Sometimes it goes crazy, fights your manual override, doesn't know where to focus and I'm pretty sure, intentionally creates blind spots.\n\nOn the positive side, I think that the main story was decent, the roster of characters is nice, I really liked to see the interactions between the Batfamily members, and grew fond of Jason Todd, of whom I only had little to no knowledge. It didn't feel at all like the main cast were simple characters, it felt like they had complex and developed identities.\n\nAlso, there were, would I say, side-main-quests? involving Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze and Clayface with their own storyline, I guess. Albeit I didn't do them, these would extend the gameplay time and enjoyment of said activities, especially if you were to play with a coop partner.\n\n[h3]Final thoughts[/h3]\nAll in all it's a decent game, although pretty grindy. The gameplay loop ended up very repetitive and annoying on the long run, which is why after the first couple of hours, I decided that I'd speedrun the game, because I wanted to see the story to its conclusion. I barely managed to keep up until the end. If it were any other world, I would've quit a long time ago. I wouldn't recommend it if you are going to play it solo. With a coop partner and a good sale, I would say go for it.",

With that said, there are many well-thought-out play mechanics with a unique fighting system and upgrades, and the ability to craft suits and mods for your suit SEEMS like a good idea, but I feel the crafting is very poorly executed. I do like all the variations and elemental effects and whatnot, but it is very confusing when I get blueprints (blueprints for batsuits are dropped by enemies or something???) and I'm not sure why it's necessary to have just a ton of useless things.\n\nThe main story's very good. But I wouldn't have chosen that voice for Bruce Wayne, or Batman, or Jason Todd.\n\nThe random emails are strange and all the notifications for the hundreds of things that get updated all the time, like emails, crafting items / materials, etc. And idk, but I feel like Jason Todd wouldn't ever go to a gay pride parade in costume to help celebrate. Like, I really don't feel that would be his style at all. Idk, maybe that's just me.\n\nI've played enough of this game by now that I'm hooked by the story, and can appreciate the fighting moves and so forth and how challenging the boss fights can be, but as a whole I just don't like it. Again, just wish there was a thumbs-sideways button.\n\nUPDATE: Now that I've finished the game, there were some veritable ups and downs in both gameplay and story. I'm sure the experience is better for multi-player players than for a soloist. I played entirely as Batgirl so only know that side of things, but still, I think overall I'd give it these kinds of scores:\n\n5/5 replayability and collections (counting history of structures / etc)\n4/5 main story (some things didn't make sense if not playing with others)\n3/5 abilities / leveling up system\n1/5 suit customization\n1/5 weapon customization\n2/5 for alignment / believability of characters (including but not limited to being able to hit / run over citizens w/out penalty (from what I could tell), etc)\n2/5 for sidequests in the city\n2/5 for side villain missions (could have been a chapter or so deeper, one in particular was extremely buggy for me)\n\nSo yeah like around a 2 or 3 out of 5 overall for me.",

        "review": "Unfortunately, this game is soulless. It feels like a mediocre live service game trapped inside a bad Arkham game. \n\nThe characters and the writing is okay, the issue is the gameplay. In the Arkham games, you had Batman and all his upgrades and abilities and it felt cool walking and gliding across the city, taking down criminals through various creative ways, hiding in the shadows. Now you have to upgrade four character simultaneously who all play worse than the aforementioned protagonist and the combat is incredibly boring and repetitive for all of them. There aren't really cool abilities and the combat system is somehow worse now, with some abilities completely not working, like a chain attack break or the perfect combos for Red Hood. If the enemies shoot at you and you are in the open you might as well give up. You can't use gadgets during combat (you can throw stuff, but it feels like sneezing on the enemy) making every encounter very samey.\n\nTraversing the city is equally boring. First because the grapple system is infinitely worse than gliding, which sadly only one character can do. Architecture wise, the game is a set back as well, gone is the awesome gothic-noir aesthetic. Now the city looks like your standard US city at night, that's not interesting or engaging to look at and every single area looks the same. Whose idea was it to make everything bland? There are civilians now in Gotham, but they don't interact with you and they aren't used in creative ways. The map is also gigantic, with mostly empty spaces. I much preferred the smaller, but incredibly tightly designed layout of Arkham City, where every area was used for some creative storytelling bit.\n\nThe game just feels wrong. Like they initially wanted to make an Avengers like looter shooter game, but then pivoted to a linear story, and forgot to adjust the UI or the game design. Like upgrades only apply in the main safe house. Why? The map barely has things happening and you constantly have to ride your motorcycle through empty roads to get to anywhere. But why bother? The encounters are not interesting, the dialogue of thugs is generic, there is no diegetic storytelling through missable thug dialogue, like before.\n\nAll this could be forgiven, but the controls are so bad, I lost the majority of my fights because my character just wouldn't respond to a button press properly. Like whose idea was to have the jump button on shift? Except it's not really a jump, unless you are next to wall. But if you are next to rail, it could also mean, you jump over it, right into the enemies. Most areas are not designed with combat in mind, so you get stuck in geometry constantly. Combos are not interesting to maintain and it's impossible to target enemies during combat, so if some thug is preparing to shoot at you, and you want to batarang him, your character will likely just throw a batarang to somewhere off screen. \n\nI thought, playing the game a bit and trying out the heroes would be fun, but at some point I realized I wasn't having any fun here. The story is the only okay element. Feels more like committee design.",

The first 3-4 hours of the game were enjoyable, and the Harley Quinn mission was particularly good (the background score for that mission was excellent). However, too many side missions may slow down the pace of the game, and, as usual, revenge and betrayal play a significant role in the pre-climax. I played it with Red Hood, However, other characters felt weak in comparison. Ultimately, it's your choice which character to play, but the ending was open and lacked a clear conclusion, which was quite disappointing. The experience will be better if you play on medium to hard settings, as the game could become easy if you focus too much on side missions. The OST is good overall.

After refunding Suicide Squad I thought and hoped that this would be better, and it is, but it wasn't enough for me. The combat is absolutely rubbish compared to the Arkham games, Mad Max and Shadow of Mordor games. \n\nThe cutscenes are amazing and the Batman vs Ra's al Ghul intro really made me hope that I would get hooked, but I didn't because so many important systems of the game just didn't work for me: \n\nCombat: Like I said, crap compared to these games: Arkham games, Mad Max and the Shadow of Mordor. \n\nTraversal: Traversing is one of the highlights in the Arkham series and here it feels so bad.  The \"good\" character traversalsystem you have to unlock (wtf?) + The bike feels like a tank and develops no sense of speed while driving. \n\nGear system: This actually killed the game for me. Who in the *f-ing* world thought it was a good idea to put a gear system a la Destiny into a superhero game? yeah -> this was definitely the deathblow for me. \n\nOn the bright side: I want to replay the Arkham games and finish Mad Max. \n\nI really hope that those two games were just an accident of corporate greed and that they'll never do anything like that again and that the next one will be something great again. \n\n#MakeSuperheroGamesGreatAgain",

        "review": "Gotham Knights, the game where you don\u2019t get to be Batman but instead play as his lovable understudies. Think of it as the superhero version of being handed a salad when you ordered a steak\u2014it\u2019s technically food, but it\u2019s not what you wanted.\n\nThe game sets up an intriguing premise: Gotham without Batman. But the city itself doesn\u2019t feel drastically different from what we\u2019ve seen in the Arkham games. Sure, the criminals are getting bolder, but the absence of Batman doesn\u2019t feel as world-shaking as you\u2019d expect. Instead, Gotham remains more or less the same chaotic place, only now with four caped crusaders instead of one..\n\nPlaying Gotham Knights is like stepping into a pair of oversized Batman boots\u2014except they don\u2019t fit right, and you keep tripping over yourself. Combat is fine, the fluidity of Arkham Knight's combat is gone, replaced with a more simplified, button-mashy style that\u2019s serviceable but less refined. Sure, you\u2019ve got different playstyles with the four Knights\u2014Batgirl\u2019s hacking, Robin\u2019s stealth, Nightwing\u2019s agility, and Red Hood\u2019s raw power\u2014but none of them quite capture the poetic brutality of Arkham's free-flow fighting. The problem is that every time you punch a bad guy, you can\u2019t help but think, \u201cBatman would\u2019ve done that cooler.\u201d\n\nGotham Knights swaps out gliding for a Batcycle, which is kind of like trading a jet engine for a moped. The Batcycle gets the job done, but it\u2019s not the most exciting ride. And while each Knight does have their own unique traversal abilities (Batgirl can glide like Batman, Nightwing has a Fortnite glider, Robin teleports, and Red Hood jumps around like an angry superhuman), it lacks the thrilling simplicity of Batman\u2019s cape-glide and grapple combo. The movement feels more clunky and less like you\u2019re a stealthy creature of the night.\n\nGotham City looks fantastic, as it always does, but it\u2019s less \u201cliving, breathing city\u201d and more \u201csuperhero theme park\u201d. Everywhere you turn, there\u2019s a conveniently placed group of thugs just waiting for a beatdown.  The side quests are... there. Solve crimes, beat up people, rinse, repeat. But what truly stands out is how every crime feels like the same crime, just copy-pasted into different alleys. I mean, if you\u2019ve fought one Gotham thug, you\u2019ve fought them all. Even the goons look like they\u2019re unionized into using the same 3 wardrobe sets.\n\nGotham Knights is fun in its own right\u2014especially with the co-op aspect\u2014but it lacks the refined combat, thrilling traversal, and immersive world that made Arkham Knight so iconic. If you go into the game expecting Batman: Arkham Knight 2, you\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment.",

        "review": "I don't like it. It's like devs took all the mechanics from the Arkham series, stripped everything fun from them and slapped annoying \"game as a service\" elements. It just feels like a waste of time. You would get a much, MUCH better game by stripping these annoying systems. What we've got is a boring game that for some people will be too exhausting to even finish it. \n\nJust take a look at some examples why this game does not respect your time:\n- separated equipment for each character \n- You have to craft equipment for each character separately \n- As in some kind of mmo game, you collect resources to craft equipment in the first place\n- You get better equimpent but at the same time enemies scale as the game goes by, so you don't really feel more and more powerful. You simply craft better equipment to keep up with the enemy scaling\n- Hundreds of useless \"challenges\" (game as a service elements) to unlock, or get things, like for example - beat 5 enemies with shield, make a 10 perfect dodges and so one\n- Randomly generated events just for the sake of letting you grind resources\n- Each missions have activities with optional subtasks that usually require more time spend for just a few more resources gains\n- Very slow running animations,\n- Very slow bike speed\n- There is no point of trying to be sneak, because many events you can just brute force (it's also usually much quckier this way)\n- You have 4 characters but from practical perspective they are the same in the long run. Just a slightly different dialogues, animations and some special skills that most of the time you won't use it anyway.\n-  Too many collectibles. In previous games at least games, you had a system for finding easily and they required you to do something - simple puzzle to make them more exciting. Here? You need to find on google guide, find collectible on the map and press interaction button to pick it up, that all. So much fun when you need to repeat this more than 150 times (amount of collectibles in game).\n- Unlocking fast traver requires the hardest thing that you can imagine - finding the drone and waiting. There is no puzzle, no fight, just find the dron, scna it and wait.\n- You need to do random looking events to move the story further\n\n\nEven if it's supposed to be the reboot or something, it does not matter as game is just simply below average and much worse than the Arkham series.\n\nNot to even mention taht there are other problems with this game:\n- stealth is much simplier (there are no gadgets to use), so it gets boring quickly especially when you will find out that most of the time you can just use brute force (engage standard combat)\n- Traversal is less fluid - no cape to fly, slow vehicles, annoying fast travel unlocks\n- Graphically it's ok, but I prefer better design instead of boring graphical fidelity\n- You often have to go back to the main base. Not only because for the sake of pushing the story further, but also for crafting purposes (you can't craft new equimpments anywhere else). In those cutscenes, you just listening boring dialogues. Can't they just use radio communications for that?\n- The combat system is simplified compared to the Arkham series, and is probably broken because of the poorly implemented game as service elements. It's less fun, and you can often cheese it by just shooting enemies from a distance (of course if you hame high enough weapon crafted)\n- UI/menu design. This is related to game as a services. I suspect there were a bigger plans for this system, but I guess after seeing how much of a success was Marvel's Avengers game, they've decided to tone down those elements.\n\nThe main story looks interesting, but I have no strength to reach the end due to gameplay.\n\nFrom technical perspective. Game is CPU bound/hungry (especially in the open world), but overall it's fluid, like incredibly fluid especially taking into consideration that game is running on Unreal Engine 4 that is famous for stuttering. However, the game have poorly implemented draw distance. It's distracting when driving motorbike (although this could also be due to me installing mod for faster motorbike)\n",

There's some wonderful tactical moves to be made and the animations are a joy to watch as she kicks a Freak's head to the ground after a perfect evade. \n\nI read reviews both positive and negative before I buy a product. Now that I've put in a reasonable amount of game-play, I'm baffled by the profusion of negative reviews. I find this game addictive and quite enjoyable, and in addition to the fighting, the story helps draw me in further. I personally find the many negative reviews unwarranted. \n\nIs the game without flaws? Of course not, but they are minor, in my opinion, and almost unnoticeable. I'm attempting to find some scathing criticism about the game that would reflect the criticism of the many negative reviews. Perhaps, the common routine of the night patrol can lead to boredom, but so far I enjoy flying above the incredible city of Gotham, and then swooping down upon an unsuspecting goon with a takedown. Or doing a wheelie on the Batcycle and then ejecting from it into the middle of a pack of Regulators with my sensually-tight oufit, raw superhero energy, batarang, and playful banter.\n\nEach game has an arc of entertainment and Gotham Knights will continue to give me quite a few more hours of play. As well, I'm looking forward to sharing the game with my nephew in cooperative. \n\nOn sale, an obvious deal. At full price, that's questionable. I'd wait for another sale just in case your expectations, and what you find fun, is different than mine.\n\nBatgirl rocks!\n\n8 out of 10 \n\n",

The one thing I think needed more time to work on is traveling mechanics because I feel like they are too slow, even the bike is feeling slow. One thing this game amazed me compared to other Arkham Games or Batman Movies is how it made Bruce feel like a human in his left audio files, I didn't feel his human side anywhere like they did here, so far this is my favorite side objective.And I also love how the characters look, very well made models and I appreciate that. I still have quite a lot to play but good job so far, I'll update the review at a later date.\nUPDATE: I have finished the game on main story and New Game + and I loved the story, the side objectives were a bit boring but still ok in the first playthrough but in new game plus doing everything again got me bored really fast, the collectibles were nice and the movement improved in game once you unlock fast travel so it helps in that regard. I have to mention I disliked Heroic Assault, too grindy and no players to do it with.\nIn my opinion the game is a must play, it's not perfect but let's be honest it's better than some other stuff you can find out there but the msrp the game launched at was a bit much, I think 40$ for this is the sweet spot that is should've launched at and around 30$ with discounts.",

You actually end up doing nothing of importance throughout the whole story! \r\n\r\nSuch a shame because the story was very unique! And all the characters were spot on! And the concept of a world without Batman, watching the knights go through mourning, was very moving! So if you want to experience some cool semi-Arkham style gameplay and have fun with friends, I'd get this game.

The story is okay though not too compelling.\n\nBut the movement is so sluggish and unresponsive in this title, it makes combat frustrating. Sometimes in order to do an action I have to spam the button for 2-4 seconds until it finally registers (say, drop down from a ledge). This unresponsiveness can make combat quite irritating in moments especially on higher difficulties. You also have to make sure you stop moving about 1-2 seconds before you actually want to stop due to the unresponsiveness. It never really feels like I'm in control of my movement.\n\nThe camera angles are rough as well. In the middle of combat I am frequently blinded by my camera squishing into a wall if I get too close to buildings and such. And aiming with the grappling hook often makes no sense. When standing still and about to grapple it will suddenly aim somewhere else last moment, usually some ledge very high right above me. Which is unfortunate because besides the motorcycle/fast travel for longer distances your main way of getting around is grappling from building to building. It feels like a slower, worse Spiderman in that sense, especially with the near useless travel powers each hero gets.\n\nI found myself wanting to quit more than keep playing so I decided to uninstall and leave my play through where it is. Maybe I'll pick it up again one day but as of right now this title is not worth it even on sale, just get the Batman games.",

Although, i love the main characters, especially Dick's relationship with Jason, they all very colorful in personality\n\n-GRAPHICS-\nThe voice acting and the graphics are the best things i can say about the game, it's pretty and simple enough, but Gotham City looks a little bit generic and uninspired.\n\n-GAMEPLAY-\nI bet this is the thing that makes people has mixed opinion about this game, the combat is fun AFTER you unlocked several Abilities or upgrades with cool combos and animation, but the animations are cool, it's junky AS FUCK, but if you're patient enough, you're definitely going in on a good ride, until you realized that it's the same thing over and over again because as you gets stronger, so does the enemy, so the sense of progress is so disapproving.\n\nIt tries to introduce stealth, and it's very satisfying when me and my co-op friend execute a whole operation with only stealth, but it only happened like once or twice since it's very inconsistent with how the enemies will caught you, and the options to do stealth is VERY limited, so it gets repetitive in an already repetitive gameplay loop\n\n-CONTROLS-\nThis is the most annoying thing of all, there's no forgiving in this, when your character needs to turn, it takes a second for them to twist their body, input delay is also a problem since you have to be quick to evades attack from the enemies, the parkour is slow but thanks to the grappling hook, it gets fun.\n\nBUT THE F*CKING GLIDER, i play Nightwing most of the time and i tell you, his F*CKING GLIDER is A BIG HORSE.... RADISH, IT SUCKS, there are time trial challenges with the glider, and HOLY CRAP ARE THEY SUCKING BIG TOES, because the glider doesn't want you to go where you want to go, you touched a wall ? SORRY IDIOT, IT'S TIME FOR YOUR CHARACTER TO WALL JUMP, you touched a roof ? WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE WALKING NOW, and while you try to get back on air, the timer ends, this sh*t doesn't work at all, and the guy who came up with that, deserved to go to hell.\n\ni was going recommend this game, but FUCK THE GLIDER, SUCK MY FUCKING DICK\n\n1/10\n",

        "review": "was a pretty fun superhero game until I got to the freeze boss fight. shit sucks dick. no I-frames on dodge make dodging shit in boss fights fucking terrible, and when you die it resets your entire fight. shit's fucking tragic. was having fun but I won't be playing after that boss fight becuase it is truly unplayable without being super overleveled. good luck doing the boss fight hitless. he has this on move where he goes to the edge of the map sometimes and then tracks you with a beam that he starts up after a short amount of time and if you get stuck against a wall, you garanteed dead because it's a stun that garantees a massive hit from him that will likely kill you. all becuase no i-frames during dodge.\r\n\r\nalso, no i-frames during cut-scene moves that you use in games, so if you want to do something cool like use your reload ability as redhood, don't, it's better to just do a regular reload that use the ability, and that's all the ability does, locks you into an animation where you reload where you can get hit and take full damage instead of just you reloading normally and being able to move around and dodge shit.\r\n\r\nit has some really good bits but there's so much that's just been over looked, it's lacking some really basic things that most of these style of games have. I'm just lucky I got it from humble bundle with Sifu so this trainwreck doesn't cost me money",

After getting used to the awkward controls, you can quickly traverse the map and missions. The level design of most missions is exceptionally good for a coop-ready, story-driven narrative. Dialogue is cringy at times, but fits the general tone of the game. The fighting mechanic is engaging and it's fun to customize equipment and skills while including classic looting/leveling. Recommended, especially with coop campaign!",

For example, there are some times where I'm trying to tell the character I'm playing as to grapple in a certain direction and they just won't, and it's common to get temporarily stuck on something or another player because you can collide into each other, even in small confined areas.\r\n\r\nDespite the things previously mentioned, I loved the story told by this game, the characters, the music, the beautiful and atmospheric scenery and levels. It's extremely fun to play with a friend, going around the city and stopping crimes, fighting against various characters in the Batman rogue gallery, and exploring every corner of Gotham. \r\n\r\nAs of right now, the reviews on the game seem to be mixed and it doesn't seem like it'll be changed anytime soon, and I completely understand because of the state the game was apparently released in, but in my opinion it's definitely worth playing now.",

        "language": "english",
        "review": "First, I'd like to preface to everyone, this is NOT in anyway related to the Arkham series. Not in gameplay, nor story.\r\n\r\nNow with that out of the way lets start with one subject that bothers a lot of people nowadays. DEI.\r\nThis game does have DEI in it, but not in a way that I think woke people would want. A lot of the criminals are women for some reason, which would be normal for the league of shadows but not every mob. And there are a few pride flags hidden around the place. The one in the belfry is on the top floor, an area you'll go to only for certain optional story segments, and a few references of pride parades in emails, that most people will not read. So on the DEI part of the game I'd say they just did the bare minimum to get their paycheck without affecting the game or story.\r\n\r\nGameplay: This isn't Arkham, as I said earlier. It does not have a slingshot combat system with an emphasis on countering attacks. It is more akin to a Spiderman game. You have your melee light/heavy attacks where heavy attacks end combos, And you have a light and heavy ranged attack where heavy has no combo but act as an AoE that can hit multiple enemies and dodging enemies. Other than that you can aim your ranged and dodge in a character specific manner.\r\nEvery character has their own skill sets that differentiate the way they play.\r\nNightwing is an acrobat so he jumps from target to target very quickly, having a special abilities promote this playstyle, such as an ability to pounce on an enemy, bounce and then grapple towards the next enemy.\r\nRed-hood has a ranged playstyle, with greater aimed shot damage, better attack rate with range and abilities that allow him to unload his guns on anyone infront of him.\r\nBatgirl is a more balanced fighter, using both her melee and ranged to great effect, using her grapple to bring enemies closer to her and having a variety of special abilities that do no focus on any single asspect of gameplay.\r\nRobin is best at AoE and stealth, using his bo-staff to hit multiple enemies at once and quickly disappearing from combat. Being the only one who can stealth knockout large enemies and use perches to tie enemies up, Robin is amazing when stealth is your favorite aspect.\r\n\r\nTalking of stealth... Since each character has a different playstyle, stealth may feel a bit off for certain characters. Everyone can sneak around, silently take down smaller opponents from any direction, be it from behind, hanging above them, below them or even while mid air or rushing them down quickly before they can alert anyone. But some characters aren't that great at it. Mainly being Red-hood. He is a lot clumsier, and can make you feel like something is really off with the stealth.\r\nFor example, every character can aim their ranged attack to attract an enemy to a certain location, but Red-hood uses guns which doesn't make much sense that the enemies will be attracted to the point of impact instead of the source of the gunshot. But hey, it still works...\r\nAnd both Robin and Batgirl have special abilities for stealth that Nightwing and Red-hood don't have which increases the off feeling for stealth while playing them.\r\nOverall, both the combat and stealth are quite satisfying and fun.\r\n\r\nStory: The story of the game is servicable. it starts off with an awesome cutscene of batman fighting Ra's Al Ghoul, ending with the death of both and the call to action to our 4 heroes. The game is filled with beautifully made and choreographed cutscenes that are specific to the host player's character, meaning that the story can unfold with 4 variations. The story is still the same, but the attention to detail in the interactions between different characters and the different characters of the main cast is great to see, and IMO is sorely needed in other games that include multiple playable pre-made characters.\r\nOther than that, the story falls to mediocraty due to the supporting cast.\r\n\r\nLoot and progression: Now we're getting into one of the biggest controversy around this game. This game was planned to be a \"games as a service\" type game, and so it include loot and a rudamentry crafting system. And at first glance this system seems like it's important. That it may force you to play a single character and not allow you to enjoy everyone else, or that it will require grinding between story sections. But no, it's actually not that important. Levels are shared for all four heroes, and after every mission you get specific loot for all four characters that is usually better than what you can craft. It does affect end-game, where when you do \"Heroic assault\" This game's dungeon system, you will only get rewards for the specific character you played. Other than that, getting loot is easy, resources are plentiful, and other than a bit a of a drop in power for a few moments after selecting a different character, you come back really quickly.\r\nThe downside of this system is that it makes the difficulty of the game spike up and down really drastically.\r\nThe game uses a gearscore system, called power, that doesn't really tell you how good your gear is, but simply give an arbitrary number. A 300 power weapon can be weaker than a 100 power weapon, it all depends on the other stats. But the rest of the game follows the power system and adjusts according to that, so you may find yourself with over 1000 power but doing little damage, or the opposite, having 500 power but one-shotting everyone.\r\nAlso, enemies have their health and to a lesser degree, their damage, tied to their tier. Regular shooter can be one shot while a veteran may need a bit of a pounding. You'd expect that the level next to their health be a more accurate indicator of their power, but not really. Stealth, on the other hand, really balances things out since everyone KO's instantly to stealth, and grapple attacks do so much damage that they either insta KO or remove over half of any enemy's health-bar.\r\n\r\nTraversal and Open-world: Gotham is a beautiful city, it has shanty-town like  slums, colorful streets with neon signs everywhere lighting up the smog and fog of the city. It has beautiful old sections lined with cobblestone and brick buildings, along the more modern streets with their clean and slick deisgnes. There's art in every corner of this city. Activities in the city are quite normal for open-world games these days. You got random crimes going on around. They can be mugging, attempts to break into buildings, beating up cops, etc. And there's the pre-maditated crimes, which can be more engaging. Bank robberies, Kidnapping, gang wars, etc. Other than that you get the regular activities. Collectibles and races, which we'll get into later.\r\nThe rest of Gotham might seem a bit dead. Certain areas are more densely populated than others, but you don't tend to see large groups of people or cars. But this can be explained with the high rate of criminality in Gotham. When passing civilians, some will be in awe of seeing you, most will be apathetic, while others will either shame you or get away from you hinting to the fact that they are likely criminals themselves. Which makes Gotham a dangerous place to walk around at night.\r\n\r\nNow, how do you traverse Gotham city? Every one of the Bat-family has accesses to their own Motorcycle (batcycle) which can be speedy enough to go around, but after a completing a few early game challanges you can unlock a character specific movement system. Batgirl gets to glide like Batman speeding downwards and converting speed to upwards lift when needed. Robin gets to teleport short distances (I say short, but it's about 300 meters per jump). Nightwing gets a Jet Glider that allows him to fly at a constant rate. While Red-hood gets a mystical jump that allows him to jump on magic platforms in the air, prolonging the distance he can jump. Other than that, every character gets their own grapple to zip around the city, and small arenas.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, the game is quite good",

Also, if you wanna compare it to the Arkham franchise just keep scrolling, nothing 4 u here, bc it simply isn't that and it doesn't have to be.\n\nBut what it doesn't have to be either is tokenistic and inclusive. It's supposed to be a game for people who can deal with racism and inequality. Amen. Not the girly dudes, not your average women's rights acivist, but an adult person who undersands the world doesn't work in a way where everyone is equally accepted. Bc it's DC and DC is dark, it's unforgiving and not for the faint of heart. in Gotham, criminals prevail, bones are broken, people get killed and so on and gay people and women as big fighters apart from league of shadows are just not a thing. Even more so, those kind of people would get bullied even harder in Gotham lmao. It's funny how the majority of veteran fighters are female, like, the only accurate part is the shockwave a godmother causes when they jump and land on top of you. Yeah, u read right, god-mothers! Bruh ....\n\nThe cringy banter, the robin being an absolutely unbearable nerd (i like nerds, but not THIS kind of nerds), nightwing being just ok as always and redhood wanting to be menacing, but comes off like a try-hard every single time. Batgirl is also one of the more decent characters, but so anoying sometimes. Her one extremely redeeming feature is her ass and her combat style.\n\nBut brother, is the gameplay loop ever fun, if you have a buddy to play with. Simple, nothing over-the-top, loot-based, repetitive, but story-wise well paced and balanced. I fuck with the game, all the bs aside. Also all the suits are fucking awesome. Some really good hits and some unforgivable misses with this one. Buy at a deep discount, humble or instant gaming for even less.",

Apart from that, the game feels very tame like it's constantly on 'easy mode' trying to hold my hand the whole way, whilst also withholding certain crucial information through poor design rather than intentional tutorial escalation. The missions are annoying in that they only give you your sub-objectives whilst you're in combat... the driving feels very floaty compared to GTA and Cyberpunk... the satnav sometimes gets it wrong... the grappling hook travel is stop-and-start rather than Spiderman... and one time I was jumping my bat-bike through the air and misjudged an overhang that smashed Batgirl in the face at high speed but instead of being ripped off the bike and hurled backwards she didn't even notice. Disappointing, but at least I got it cheap in a Humble Bundle.",

You are not going to have a good time moving around the map, it just feels very slow most of the time, even after you unlock teleports; driving mechanics for the motorcycle are too oversimplified and pathetic.

This game definitely has some flaws though.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this game is the traversal, it feels extremely boring grappling/jumping around Gotham. There is a batcycle, but I feel like it should be a teeny bit faster than it is, not too much faster, but a tad bit faster would feel better imo. \r\nAnother problem I feel I have with this game is how tanky the enemies feel when I'm fighting one even a single level above me, ESPECIALLY the brutes. The brutes with the shields are brutal to fight on any difficulty other than the easiest one when they're any level above me. Maybe it's just a skill issue, which would be likely since I'm still new to the RPG kind of games. \r\n\r\nI have some other complaints, but none that stand out from those two.
