Do what you will.[/h1]\n\nI don't know why I decided to play this game now and why I didn't get to it earlier, but it was an exciting adventure.\n\nOverall, the game is quite interesting and intense, with an important enough theme in the story. I finished the whole story and about 10 side missions in 30 hours and that's the optimal length. During this time the game did not get boring, but at the same time the story is fully revealed. \n\nEven today the graphics of the game are on a very high level with excellent optimization. \n\nI was also quite surprised by how the story system is organized along with the online. I was very surprised when I reached the main story mission and was killed in the back not by an NPS but by a player. Also, I soon began to notice and participate in online missions that randomly appear in the game. \nP.S. this feature can be disabled in the game's settings - if it does not suit you. But I would advise you to leave it enabled as it adds variety and fun to the game.",

        "review": "Its the best of the three Watch_Dogs games. Marcus' personality clashes hard with the fact that your going to end up slaughtering dozens of security guards with 3D printed weapons. Serious narrative dissonance. These games are at their best when you can go full stealth, which is pretty hard in this level. This game lacks the hiding in plain sight mechanic that disguises allow you in Legion. Overall I had fun with it. I was surprised to see that the multiplayer is really active despite being an 8 year old game. I had to turn off most of the multiplayer functions because I was getting tired of getting randomly attacked while I was just trying to get to a single player mission and then getting trapped in a ten minute game of hide and seek.",

        "review": "I didn't think I would like this game due to the tonal shift coming from Watch_Dogs 1, but I ended up loving it. It's linear in the ways it needs to be, and in a liberating way, open-ended in it's mission design. There is no correct way to go about completing a mission, it just matters that you complete it and get out of there. Luring someone with building access (no access key) outside and just moving in behind them before the door closes is perfectly viable. The writing is not all that serious, it's more fun than anything. It is serious when it needs to be though. Characters are very likable, even the villains and then the DedSec squad who all have certain archetypes which differentiate from one another. \n\nThis doesn't mean I don't have some complaints-- namely gunplay sucking (not counting the vulnerability of Marcus, his low health, I believe that's intentional to prevent you from just gunning your way through all missions, although still a viable strategy in some missions), and melee takedowns sometimes removing you from cover, giving away your position. Animations in general are variable in length and speed, and while this serves to address what would be a lack of variety if they had just used one animation for each action like a takedown or vaulting over something, it can at times be inconsistent. The animations are of generally high quality though, and the sounds to accompany add to it.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. Get it on sale, $50 is stretching it to be honest but it may still be worth it at that price depending on how you view it.",

The game is super punishing when it comes to attracting police attention... we're talking about hours long, non-stop epic car chases to the death from police heli snipers and armored vehicles... way higher difficulty than GTA until you max all your hacking skills.\n\nPolice vs Gang warfare is a sight to behold. I sat in my Ferrari watching the Auntie Shu gang strategize cover fire and tactics and gunned down a whole squad of police and torched their vehicles XD\n\nAwesome sequel to WD1, but made so much worse due to game instability and the garbage that is Ubisoft Connect. If you can endure all the random game crashes and potential lost progress, then you will be on one helluva ride.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n20 minutes installing Ubisoft Connect, 10 minutes loading into the game, 5 minutes of gameplay, and multiple black screens and crashes. WTAF?\n\nUbisoft quality: faulty GPU auto-detect and setting everything to ULTRA.\nStill crashes every other cutscene after dialing it down.\n\nCrashes randomly and frequently.\nWill never buy an Ubisoft game again.",

        "review": "If you enjoyed the gritty drama involving Aiden Pierce avenging his dead niece and running against crime syndicates, Blume CEO, and stuck between the illusive Deadsec and finishing the mission of shutting down an entire smart city? Don't worry, 10 hours into watchdogs 2 is a band of misfit \"Anarchists\" of an autistic kid used as comedic relief, Mary sue protagonist, and a graphic designer that in contrast to remaining an elusive hacker terrorist group, wants to not be silenced and prints T-shirts, posters, spray paints and aims to gain followers like this is a personal instagram. Lets throw out any seriousness and roll out the \"Epic Bacon\" youtube poop humor to undermine any serious conversations other than \"We're oppressed dude, it's just not right man, so uncool, so unfair my brotatochip\" Quirky, snippy, and playful storytelling ruins the expectations that the first game set. Bugs still exist, mainly graphical issues (Check the threads). New exciting gameplay however, from the RC Car, to the drone with new ways to hack the environment leads to more options and gameplay styles is the only thing saving this game but if you're put off by forced campy monologing, an underwhelming story, and inconsistent tones between both games then I'd pass on playing this and move onto legion where it's main focus in gameplay.",

I don't mention this just because either, this is a message consistently pushed through the whole game.\nSidequest and online content are quite nice at the start but quickly became a slog, it's repeat and repeat and repeat of the same, just Ubisoft content in all known quality and quantity.\n\nIt was one of the first typical examples of modern trash I played.\nAbsolutely don't recommend.",

        "review": "This game is more like the underdog story a success, somewhat of a fan favorite. I know irl kids at the time when this came out hyped this thing up and I know some people still do love this game after the first game recieved huge backlash (went overboard and unfairly imo) for the graphics downgrade controversy and people were less likely to participate for this and Ubisoft sure have delivered it as far as I'm concerned and there will probably be no game like this.\nGame companies have tried so hard to copy GTA and of all my experience, Saints Row 2 and 3 are the closest thing that are so similar to the style and gamepaly of GTA, and Watch Dogs 2 comes very close second or third that can stand toe to toe in terms of how much freedom you can get in a sand box open world game thats close to GTA.\n\nPros\n\n+Quality and polished game experience\n+Amazing map of San Francisco. Hell, I would even say this is way better and more lively than Grand Theft +Auto V or any open world cities.\n+Excellent choice of music and radio songs\n+Great writing\n+Closest thing to GTA San Andreas simliarity. Playing this game \n+Quality animations and parkour\n+QoL and features like the RC Jumpers can make an interesting sandbox scenarios\n+Incredible variety of enemy variants. I never seen a police force in the game send a god damn GERMAN SHEPARDS to run after you! And the SWAT team actually have armor meaning shooting them does less damage, meaning you need to think before start blasting.\n\nCons\n\n-Bad physics and janks. \n-Artifact glitches. Somehow the game has this epilepsy seizure flickering in the sky honestly this alone makes the game unplayable. THe only way to fix that is to download a 3rd party file and disable in-game online interactions.\n-Disappearing and spawning vehicles\n-Controller not recognizing\n-Awful controls\n-Garbage PC port\n-Smooth aiming is the worst thing ever implemented in gaming. No surprise, this was carried from Watch Dogs 1.\n-Very unoptimized. I remember playing this game on my GTX 980. It didn't run well with all settings mostly on ultra. Then I had 1080. It also didn't ran very well with all settings on ultra. Then later I own the RTX 4070 and guess what? The GAME IS STILL SHIT AT RUNNING AT CONSISSTENT 60 FPS 1440P 2MSAA ON ALL ULTRA EVEN PIXEL DENSITY IS AT 1.0 SO WHAT GIVES HERE!? That's 3 goddamn generations jump of graphics card and it can't even run a 8 year old game at its full potential! \n-Crashes. The game occasionally crashes and even the crash report can't even be sent to Ubisoft...\n-Bland characters. Their designs including Marcus and Wrench are super iconic and I will not lie, these two characters are so extremely recognizable they might as well be THE gaming icons with their dope ass drips, unfortunately everyone except for Wrench and MAYBE Marcus have shit personality and not memorable, and straight up unlikeable. My most hated character is Josh, everyone in the team adores him even though he's quiet, akward and again most characters in the game , 0 personality hell I don't even think he even likes his own team, shows no compassion for them. But hey look at Sitara she's quirky! and... that's all she do! And the 4th one in the team is Horatio, yes his name is Horatio, and he does literally nothing in the story he might as well be cut from the game.\n-Same flawed designs from the last game. I have plenty of complaints from the last game and all of this still carried to this here. 1. There not enough cars and mostly empty streets and traffics, resulting to no reason to use hack to turn all green lights in the junction for lolz or so you can escape while the cops chasing you gets crashed by cars all driving to the junction at the same time. Plus, wouldn't it be cool to hack and do steam pipe explosion and when entering it it can make you \n-It is made by Ubisoft\n\nIt's such a shame because honest to God, this would have been a 10/10 masterpiece if it wasn't marred by usual shitty Ubisoft janks smeared all over this game. \n\nI highly recommend to anyone who want to play this game should own it on your Playstation or Xbox, because atleast on console ports the game is much more consistent in performance without giving you eye cancer.",

        "review": "They had a great thing going with WD1, all it needed was some tweaking and it'd have been a great sequel. But no, you got to mess with the system. \r\n\r\nNo XP on kills destroys the leveling system, now you need to get the follower shit going. Supposedly nonviolent, but your options to take people out for a limited time are a taser and shock bombs? Stealth sucks, you get spotted near immediately. No options to make Marcus hardier, dude goes down like paper. Dont try to get in gunfights either, there's no slow mo like Aiden did. All you can do is run like a bitch. Dude is taking on armored mercs.\r\n\r\nBut hey, there's new options! You can uh...tag opponents as police or gang targets. Yeah, gangsters are going to get up to Google... uh Nudle's door and kill that one specific guard. Go crazy! Set up three-way or four-way shootouts and then go in and take cash and weapons. Don't you know gangs use CtOS profiling too? By the way, you are still nonviolent - not your fault the gangs use bombs. And not your fault security corps shoot first and ask questions later. \r\n\r\nThe two new tools do make sense initially, and I was glad to get the upgrade to bomb the shit out of opponents. But that also summons the police, so good luck I guess? See stinky stealth above. At least the tools regen every time so you can retry with them as many times as you need. But then some missions DEMAND that you be present - wonder why - oh so it's the planned story beat can occur. \r\n\r\nThere's the usual tonal dissonance - Marcus and crew talk of taking on armed guards with the bravado of Navy SEALs. Old WD1 characters are brought back to add that missing cool. Marcus routinely takes on gangs in the story, but only when there's a gang-related incident are some tears shed. Death dispensing in the streets, outdated nerd references in the sheets. It's like there's a complete story about Marcus, his motivations, his past, all hidden away. Most non-protagonist protagonist ever. No central philosophy, not even positioning Marcus as a nonviolent nerd type. Seems like they wanted to go that way but got scared. The result helps nothing - not the story, not the gameplay. Upgrades are gated behind follower points or climbing puzzles, AND \"key data\" that you need to pick up in locations, and they feel weaker than they did in WD1.\r\n\r\nI did love the minigames - all the racing ones. SF is definitely more fleshed out and alive, but I still prefer the noir and grit of Chicago. The crimes you could intervene in. The good you could do as Aiden. But in WD2 it's all \"BIG GOOD\". Oh, did I mention there's a whole ass mission where you hack ATMs and destroy people's accounts giggling all the time, just to show that the bank is BAD? It feels like these missions were written by script kiddies that didn't understand that in a dystopian world, you need to feel for the people you're fighting for. When the bad guy tells Marcus the standard \"you dont understand! the people want to be told what's right!\" there's no real counter. I didn't feel as if I was really doing it for the people - I felt selfish. \r\n\r\nWhat finally did it for me was the checkpointing however. I'm a PC player and am treated well by saves. WD2 however has terrible checkpointing. There's a few missions where you'll execute the mission in perfect stealth, but as soon as you're \"downloading data\" the whole place goes on alert. Each time I fail, I get kicked back to a crane segment and must do the infiltration again. The one time I had the bright idea of staying on the crane, it bugged out and I died while sitting on it. Never uninstalled a game faster.\r\n\r\nTLDR: fun sandbox, good immersion if you want to bask in a lovingly rendered SF. as a story and a WD entry? BAD. something Jordi would give the pizza guy treatment.",

It has the most colorful and interesting map, lots of fun missions and interesting characters to follow. the first game tried to go for a hardcore hacker type of feel, whereas the sequel was more of a game that didn't take itself too seriously, and focused a lot on having fun.  Legion, the third game, kind of stepped back towards the first game, but in my opinion was largely forgettable.  Watch_Dogs 2 is so fun that I have played through the game multiple times, and I look forward to doing so again.",
