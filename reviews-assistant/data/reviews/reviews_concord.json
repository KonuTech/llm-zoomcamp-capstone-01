It's extremely unoptimized (averaging 30-40 fps on a 7900 XTX w/ 64GB of RAM, & on NVME).\n\nEven if you can get past the performance issues, the game has MAJOR balancing issues between its heroes. For example, Flark's gun is a complete abomination of a weapon that shoots floaty projectiles that do almost nothing for damage, whereas some other characters are running around one-tapping with their weapons. The time-to-kill ratio is VERY fast. For it to be this fast in a hero shooter, there *has* to be some modicum of health regen! Health pickups throughout maps are few and far between. Class-based systems are not emphasized ('Oh, big guy? Must be a tank. Oh, little guy with assault rifle? Must be a DPS...Wait, healer? healer?') You're kind of just left guessing about what to even do or how to strategize (Ironically, the game's training mode is quite enjoyable).\n\nIt's 2 core game modes to boot are a standard TDM and Area Control, which is basically Domination? Not bad game modes per se, just not something you would expect from this kind of game. This is something you see in a game like Rogue Company from Hi-Rez, which is completely free to play (and this is a $40-$60 title).\n\nIt's a shame because this game's design is fairly charming, almost feels like a Guardians of the Galaxy meets Overwatch type of hero shooter, but....it's riddled with technical issues that keep it from reaching its full potential.\n\nMaybe they'll turn it around? idk, but where it currently sits from a developmental standpoint, it seems like its A LOT to ask for. Feels like I played a really early access title.",

        "review": "As a Destiny 2 Crucible player, there are many things I like about Concord, yet I cannot in good consciousness leave a positive review due to some fundamental issues with the launch version of the game.\r\n\r\nFirst, the obvious problem is a lack of players. This means when you do find a game, you will most likely find the same players. There can be no doubt that Concord has really clicked for a dozen of players, which you will find out, when your entire team of level 2 accounts blindly rushes into the open, to get absolutely destroyed in seconds. I suppose the only upside of the long queue times, is that by the time people actually get into a game, the Steam refund window will be closed.\r\n\r\nMany reviewers have already commented on the bland character designs, which is very disappointing considering the rich worldbuilding, gorgeous environments and Bungie skyboxes. I am willing to bet my Canadian pesos that if you show a random person a picture of Teo, they would be hard pressed to tell you which game he's from. The character design is not just a failure in an aesthetic sense: given that many of the crucial roles are so visually unappealing, in random games (the only ones you can currently play due to the aforementioned lack of players) everyone will lock down the same 4 or 5 characters, which results in poor team compositions. Now I am not saying that every game needs anime waifus, but it is very important to make support and tank characters visually appealing, so that people would want to pick them. Meanwhile, players will be wondering how the hell Daw passed military qualification, lock down Star Child, and then rush into a chokepoint to get instantly obliterated.\r\n\r\nFor a $40 game, the customisation is simply not there. Each character will have 5-6 recolours, and a low-effort legendary skin that will often be somehow worse than the default outfit. For a game with such high production values, it is puzzling that the developers have spent no effort on making cosmetics unlocks visually-appealing. By comparison, if you were to spend that money on a couple of season passes for the Free-to-Play games Concord is attempting to compete with, you will end up with a bunch of outrageous, distinct outfits that probably play the sad whale song each time you score a kill.\r\n\r\nIn Concord, you can unlock variants of the 16 classes through five sets of objectives, with some variants being significantly stronger than the starting loadouts. I am definitely not a fan of this system, and it feels like a cheap way to add unlockables instead of designing a comprehensive loadout system: some guns just don't feel great, and it would be great to have some gear customisation options, instead of avoiding a character because their one weapon sucks. Yes, I get the game balance angle, but surely Concord have enough combined experience making PVP games to balance about 18 different guns!\r\n\r\nThe gunplay is mostly satisfying, some maps are quite good, and there is a lot of good game design, which makes Concord encounters interesting and enjoyable. Nonetheless, with all these issues, I just can't recommend the game and, by the time you read this review, the game will simply not have enough players to be worth saving. Also, and this can't be stressed enough, this game took 8 years to make. WHY??",

Perhaps made for less skilled gamers (which on the surface is fine)\n- not enough variation. The game modes available would get stale after a while. The cut scenes, while nicely rendered are pretty pointless not affecting the overall gameplay. It's a nice lick of paint on an entry level car\n\nThe gaming community critics are right - it should be free to play. Even in Sony squandered 100 million on it (which I somewhat wonder if this is true because it has an indie level game feel at times), they're not going to recoup their losses and it's not going to find the community it so desperately needs.\n\nMake it free and let the modders turn it into Unreal Tournament 99 remake (which it almost feels like at times - that's a positive), and then it might save this lumbering beast of a failure.\n\nA failure with potential, I should add. It did seem fun in places but yes I ultimately refunded because I value my $60 AUD.\n\nLastly I should add, I'm running it on an RTX 2060 and had to have it on lowest settings, frame rate dipped a lot - that could be on me cause I was trying to stream it for the short time I played it which took away from some CPU usage, but it is potentially fairly hardware intensive.",

And while I can't totally disagree with that sentiment, there was a solid game here, if nothing that would set the world on fire. \n\nSony and the rest need to stop spending hundreds of millions on the \"Games as a service\" model for every single genre of game. Game budgets are getting out of control and failure is just getting more and more expensive. We don't want you to play it safe, we want you to scale back these gargantuan rehashes of the same formulas to a level where you can actually maintain them if the player-base doesn't hit 50k concurrent players in the first week of it's life. All of the marketing and CGI promos won't save a game if the audience can get a similar experience elsewhere for cheaper. If this had shipped with any sort of substantial offline content, Sony probably wouldn't be in this mess right now.\n\nAll that being said, I wish Firewalk studios luck with whatever happens next.

They are MOSTLY bland and not distinctive enough, let alone iconic and pop. There are very few ways and different modes to actually play the game.It's overall actually very shallow in depth and story...maybe this is to be expected from season 0 of a new game like this, but everyone expects more these days. \n\nYou can bind the arrow keys to whatever you want, but for some bizarre reason, they are HARD BOUND to just \"looking\". Crouch/sprint are toggle only with no options. PC players were clearly an afterthought.\n\nThe nail in the coffin? There were 100 Steam players on today and I tried matchmaking in two different modes at noon only to get timed out at 10mins. Once crossplay is on, you can get a match easy. So the only way you are going to play the game for the entire future is with PS5 players, which is fine, but not what we want. All in all I just feel bad for the hard working devs at Firewalk. I believe this project was GROSSLY mismanaged and I think most of the devs knew what was going to happen.\n\nIT-Z is kinda cute though :)",

        "review": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiddBwE394\n\nPlease watch his video as I don't wanna type a 40 page essay explaining just how terrible these character designs are, not exaggerating but they could be the worst character designs in a modern game, and by far the worst hero shooter designs by lightyears. \n\nIve seen more interesting characters using a ps2 random character generator. Throw away npcs or trash mob designs in modern games have more going on then the rocket character does. Not only are they boring, dull, lifeless and designed by complete ametures, but they aren't even balanced. The DEI hires of the dev team gave eachother no criticism clearly and it shows as all aspects of the game are horribly designed. I can empty 2 full clips in to a heroes head, with perfect accuracy, just to get aoe splash damaged by a flying character who insta kills me in half the time with no aim. Regardless of team or skill level the highest frag hero gets 10-20 kills on their best game and average players get 2-5. You can't carry a bad team even if you're a pro, or have any affect if you can't get a strong hero. Most heroes just don't have enough in their kit to help the team as the spy character you get 2 grenades which have cooldown for some reason which just gets rid of the map and abilities for 2 seconds while the classic soldier hero gets non cool down very strong explosion grenades which have 4 slots and refill on kill. \n\nThe hero designs, pronouns, modes, maps, nothing is well designed. It seems like between all the teams experience, its still less combined than a new group of community college interns at a indie gaming company. Look at deadlock or any other hero shooter and its as if this team was new to the genre and game design all together. \n\nTLDR worst designed characters of all time, even free to play this game would not be worth your time. People say make it free, I say delist it all together, gonna plat it before that inevitably happens. Wish me luck!",

        "review": "Edit: Mass refunds and a shut down in under a month. Wow\n\nTLDR: Game is a ton of fun but I can't recommend someone spend $40 on it at this moment. If the game is made free to play, or goes on a decent sale, I would recommend. \n\nElephant in the room, player count. People will cope and say queues are still fast but that is only because there is 0 SBMM and no region locking WITH crossplay default enabled. Even still the no respawn mode (Rivalry) has long queues at all times, sometimes nobody queuing it at all. Speaking of Rivalry, players throwing to quickly farm XP has been an issue since launch weekend and devs have done nothing to fix it, they've been silent post launch. This makes the mode only playable with a full stack, which will lead to you 4-0'ing every match, at least in my experience. Suffice it to say the playercount is a massive issue. While the numbers are for sure better on playstation, I have serious doubts that they would even be called good, I suspect there is sub 500 players online at any given time as of 2 weeks post launch.\n\nThis leaves the other 2 respawn queues, TDM/Kill Confirmed and Domination/Hardpoint. These are both fun and I enjoy both, but there are issues with these modes. TDM matches are always far too short, the kill count should be increased from 30 to 50. Kill Confirmed is actually great, I don't have a suggested change for it. Domination and Hardpoint are both balanced around constant contesting. 2 good teams will lead to long matches where both teams struggle to garner a significant lead. A missmatched lobby will lead to quick games with score gaps of 100+. When these games go the distance they are great fun. Unfortunately due to the lack of SBMM, no doubt further impacted by the low player count, these long high quality matches are not the norm.\n\nThe core gameplay here is fantastic. Destiny PVP but way better. People compare this to Overwatch a lot but it plays nothing like that. Healing for example is very slow, so fights can end very quickly despite the generally long TTK if you don't play with your team or stand in the open. There are so many small details here that are very clever and do a lot to make basic hero shooter mechanics more engaging. A quick example is how this game does ability recharging. Every ability is unique in this regard. Some are on a timer like normal, others require kills, others pickups, and others character specific things like getting a scan with a different ability and interacting with that again. There are tons of small twists like this on the standard multiplayer hero shooter formula and almost all of them are great changes. The best way to engage with these systems is in the Rivalry mode, especially the crew bonus system that rewards swapping characters, but unfortunately Rivalry is kind of ruined by previously mentioned issues. \n\nPeople really don't like the character designs. I'm probably 50/50 like/hate on the roster. I really like some of the character designs like Kyps and Jabali, but then there are huge stinkers like Daw and Bazz (although when you unlock different glasses for Bazz she is way better IMO). There is 0 sex appeal here, which I think is what has most people upset even though they would never admit it. Whether or not this matters a ton is is up to you. For me this is not a major issue, I play these kind of games for the gameplay and if it looked like Roblox with fancy lighting and effects I wouldn't really care. Aside from character models the game looks very good IMO. \n\nTech wise I've only had some infrequent crashing and small bugs. I am on a 4070ti Super with an AMD 7800x3D though so I can't really comment on performance. Runs good for me, might not on a worse setup.\n\nIm a Sci Fi guy, big on Star Wars pre Disney and I love Mass Effect. This games lore/world has a lot to like. You can read about an astonishing amount of things in the \"Galactic Guide\", essentially this games prettier version of the mass effect codex. Unfortunately there is no voice acting here so it is a lot of reading. Some sneak peeks here: The entire galaxy is slowly being consumed by something called the tempest, the pseudo galaxy government known as the guild is consuming the finite resources without having a plan for when they run out, and most of the food people eat are giant squid like creatures from another planet doused in grounded up egg goo that makes it taste good. People dismiss this mode, but I think its a great addition and its clear that a lot of effort has been put into this. Were this game to have a long lifespan (which I seriously doubt at this point) there would be so many cool ways for the story to go. You can also read this while you are in queue which is very nice.\n\nThere are also the weekly \"vignettes\" but both featured so far were also in the beta so this has been extremely underwhelming as of now. \n\nWith the $40 price tag some promises were made and there was also some automatic expectations. I have been overall disappointed with the value for my money when it comes to this. One thing that was promised thanks to the price tag was no paid battle pass, which is true come launch. Progression in this game is based on your account level and individual character level. Both account and character levels earn you separate rewards. Unfortunately a lot of the rewards you will be earning here are underwhelming. Trinkets seen as battle pass filler in other games still make their appearance here despite the lack of battlepass. Here they serve as progression filler so they can tell you there is a reward in the next few levels when all it ends up being is a weapon charm you probably won't even bother to equip. There are also a TON of re-colours.\n\nFurthermore a lot of the \"big\" rewards you will eventually earn like legendary skins kind of suck. Like the character designs, legendary skins are probably 50/50 good/bad. Emari's is great and fixes a character who I don't like the regular look of. Meanwhile Jabali's biggest change is some horns on his hat. Despite some of these underwhelming rewards levelling also takes a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. With 60 hours in the game as of writing (5 or so being afk or accidentally left on) I still do not have a single character at level 20, and multiple still not at level 10. My account level is only just 50, with the hardest achievement in the game being to reach account level 100. I have only seen one of these legendary skins in the wild during a match. Progression could be 2x as fast and I would still probably think its a bit slow, but that would be a great improvement.\n\nThere is a cosmetic shop coming with the season 1 patch scheduled for October (although we will see how this schedule holds given the games launch), and I will be very upset if a bunch of way cooler skins are added with it and nothing else is added to the games current progression.\n\nI don't regret buying the game, I expected to only get 2 months or so out of it as casual shooter game I could play on the side, but I didn't think the numbers would be THIS bad. I can't recommend a purchase in its current state unless devs come out with some sort of action plan. If it ever does go free or on a deep sale I highly recommend, because the actual game that is here is very good.",

        "review": "While the rough core of the game isnt bad and there is a semblence of a stable foundation, the game doesnt innovate and even is missing critical systems needed for a multiplayer game. In this rough shape and at this price, the game has a serious problem to get the attention of potentional players as its presentation is at best lukewarm and the gameplay lacks all common improvements present in the gaming scene in the past years. Due to various issues listed bellow, I cannot recommend this game at this current state and price. I personally will keep playing the game, but with these issues, I cannot recommend it.\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay[/b] \r\nThe core of the gameplay is present and if this is your first game of this type, it may feel fresh at first, but it is lacking larger and smaller QoL improvements. One of them is partial weapon reloads, there are too many instances where you can accidentaly interrupt the realoding animation and once you want to resume it, it begin from the start. A smaller QoL feature that is missing is Assist counting as kills, this is needed in high latency lobbies. The game gas a weird long time to kill, which I am personaly not fan of.\r\n\r\n[b]In-game communication[/b] \r\nThe game has a basic pinging system and an option to opt-in into voice chat at the start of the match and that is it. The game lacks a communication wheel to say simple commands to your team like \"Group up\", \"I need healing\" or even \"Thank you\". Chat is not present at all. This team oriented game has almost no ways how to communicate as a team.\r\n\r\n[b]Crew system[/b]\r\nI feel this system is at the core the cause of the character balance issues. Some characters are strong from the get go and these feel good to play. But other you first need to apply bonuses by playing different characters and by that time in the match, you have no assurance that the actual character you want to play isnt already taken (and there is no way to tell other players you want to switc to said character). Basicaly if you wan to play a strong character, you do not need to use the crew system. If you want to play a weaker character, you first need to switch trough various different characters to make the one you want to play less bad and you will still play worse than the good characters.\r\n\r\n[b]Game modes[/b]\r\nThe game has 3 playlists, Brawl, Overrun and Rivarly.\r\nBrawl consist of TDM and TDM+ (kill confirmed)\r\nOverrun consist of Capture the zones, and capture the moving zone\r\nRivalry is a no respawn gamemode, but I never got to play it.\r\n\r\nBrawl and Overrun plays the same and most people ignore the objectives in Overrun as there is no incentive from the game to play objectives. There is no Capture the Flag, no Paylod, no Push, no PvE, no Deathmatch.\r\n\r\n[b] Multiplayer and queue times[/b] \r\nAbout a week has passed since the release of the game and depending on the time of day, you may get a quick queue time in about 30 seconds, but if you are on PC and in the EU, you may experience queue times of 2 - 3 minutes even for the most played \"Brawl\" playlist. And if you get into a match, be prepared to be places into a high latency lobby. I wasnt able to get into \"Rivalry\" playlist as the queue times went above 6 minutes and I gave up.\r\n\r\n[b]Progression and unlocks[/b]\r\nMost progression objectives are a variation of number of kills, assist, damage done, rounds played, rounds won. The progression system has minimal teamwork oriented objectives and so far none related to capturing a zone or any tied more to the gamemodes.\r\n\r\nThe game doesnt show you what item you unlock at what level, it only shows what is the current item to be unlocked, but you have no idea if the next one is something \"\"\"interesting\"\"\" or another side bar color.\r\n\r\n[b] Characters (gameplay wise)[/b] \r\n16 characters and a lot of them feels unbalanced. You get strong characters that can stand on their own like Lennox and Haymar, and on the other end of the spectrum you get Jabali with his BB gun. The overall issue is that some characters have a really low damage output and if you are in a high latency lobby and experiencing high ping and lost packets, playing those characters is misery.\r\n\r\n[b]Characters (lore wise)[/b] \r\nThe game is unable to sell the personas of the characters to the players. There is no banter between characters at the start of the match that would tell you what the relation between each character is. So if you are not drawn in by the looks of the characters, there isnt much else to know about them. The only info you get is an entry which you get by leveling a character to level 3, but as of now, it only talks about their backstory.\r\n\r\n[b]Characters (visualy)[/b]\r\nMost of the characters designs feels like they need more iterations befoure they could be considered good. Some designs are just too much, like the design of Bazz would benefit from a streamlining.\r\n\r\n[b]Custom games[/b] \r\nThere is no option to host your own lobby.\r\n\r\n[b]Lore[/b] \r\nOne of the selling point of the game is its lore and how it is presented in the Galactic Guide. While the visual presentation is nice in a form of a galactic map, the game does a very poor job of connecting said lore to the gameplay. The lore set up the freegunners as oponnents to the Guild, but there is no hint of that in the gameplay at all as all is freegunners fighting each other.\r\nThe game has [b]vignetters (CGI shorts)[/b] which plays at the start of the game, but only the newest one plays and otherwise they are not present in the game at all and you need to do your own homework to find them.\r\nThere are also [b]Freegunners adventtures shorts (animated shorts)[/b] which are not in the game, there is no mention of them in the game and you need to be lucky to find them.\r\n\r\n",

I love the timed racing mode, it reminds me of Mirror's Edge parkour. More games should have skill trials like this. \n\nI'm sad to hear about Concord's early end. I guess people don't spend much money up front on multiplayer games since so many are F2P now.

So I kept playing with him every night after he got home from work and it slowly grew on me. We would always see the same people playing and be like \"oh shit it's that guy again!\" and try our best to beat them. One that stood out was a player named Milky Gluten and their buddy Shouty (I think that's how you say or write it). But they would lay us out about every time we went against them. We did beat them once or twice but my brother and I would bring them up when we were doing something else. He would say \"I bet they are 20+ Levels ahead of us now.\" or \"do you think we will see them today?\". When we did see them he would say \"lock in brother we got to beat them this time.\". GGs to both of you and you both were great opponents.\n\nI will wrap up this sob story now and say that I really did appreciate the time I spent on this game with my brother and I am sad that it is gone now. Not because the game is gone but that my brother is a little heartbroken over it being gone. He really did love the game to death. But we all have that game we love to death and hate to lose it. Mine was Battleborn and RE Operation Raccoon City which both weren't stellar games. I will end it here and say GGs to everyone who did play against my brother and I. \n\nThank you.",

Albeit this game was not worth 40 bucks considering the content and I could be wrong but it seemed like there was going to be more content dripped into it yet it didnt have this. But now if you havent yet Get your refund cause they are shutting themselves down. \n\nI enjoyed:\n-The different ways to earn charges for your abilities depending on your characters\n-Passive buffs earned from previous characters incentivizes character changes to stack buffs in each game\n-Unique Characters that make sense\n-As a paid game the cosmetics were all achievable without extra pay which is refreshing from the money grabbing games everyone falls in love with.\n-Interesting unique customization for each character (Wish there were more made it seem kinda beta with such few options\n\nDifficult to enjoy-\n- Not enough Content\n- Story feels like it grabs you in and then just leaves you there. \n- Characters dont really have any progression it seems aside from cosmetics \\\n- Basic Game modes for a game that seems to not want to be basic\n\n",

        "review": "This will be a very personal review tied to my personal experience.\nConcord deserved so much better. My honest opinion, it was fun, I loved getting to play hero shooter which was not following the f2p formula and it was a fresh breath of air after all the years Ive spent in Overwatch. To call it a clone is to admit you didnt understand the core mechanics of the game.\n\nThere were little to no team synergy as which characters built the best team or even a team doomed to lose and instead it focused on player synergy. You played your characters in the order you wanted to obtain buffs provided by their class, creating your optimal build for your favorite freegunner. It was team-based but you are the one looking out for yourself making sure you achieve your ultimate build while securing kills or the objective. There was no classic healers for you to blame if you died. Where there were classes suited for a tank role or support roles, everyone is more or less a DPS with who can fend for themselves but the game did reward those who played in a coordinated unit. The game had a slower TTK removing everyone's ability to one-shot to allow you to play out your cooldowns rather than the first person to spot the other player wins. This was up my alley but its not for those who enjoy a more sim-like experience. No character felt obnoxiously balanced at launch while Teo was quite insane during Beta but keep in mind these types of games cannot be 100% balanced but I think this game was pretty well rounded. While there were a couple of characters which were on the stronger side, during the time it didnt feel as obnoxious as Overwatch could feel at times although I can see how time would offer times in the game where balance could prove a challenge as balancing these sort of games is nothing to scuff at.\n\nI loved my time on Bazz which was my favourite character. Shes not a character im drawn to in games per usual as Im typically a support main but I loved her hyper aggressive nature and I built her to favour range and speed, sometimes with improved dodge and reload on top if I couldnt access my build by my favoured freegunners. It was a blast!\n\nI enjoyed the selection of maps to play on. During beta it didnt feel enough but once launch game around there were enough maps for me to not make it feel repetitive during the time I played. Train troubles were my favourite of the maps as it offered a fun level of tunnels and elevated angles. All maps were mirror based like arenas and if it eventually would have had more game modes I wouldve liked to see maps that were less arena likes.\n\nThe game modes were pretty standard with the exception of the single spawn game mode, that one was unique to Concord and the most competitive mode and ideal if you had a communicating 5 stack. I spent most of my time in the objective based modes which were not as hard core as single spawn but had more to offer than just TDM which were my least preferred mode.\n\nThe character designs were unique and their fashion could be really out there which was cool to see in a sci-fi as it makes me feel like this is not set in my time and their fashion has different values than the ones from my time such as how historically men wore high heels while today that has flipped. The more simpler designs opened up for more skin possibilities down the line and silhouettes were all distinct and and characters had unique movement animations even down to their dodge. I would have liked to see less humanoid aliens down the line as we have seen non humanoid characters function in shooters in the past such as Overwatch so there is where I would like to see more creative liberties taken. At launch I didnt think the skins were the strongest but there were still skins that stuck out as great, the legendary It-Z skin for example looked great while Jabali's legendary suffered the same issue as Overwatch's Junkerqueen's legendary skins did at launch where they are different but they do the same thing as the default skin, like it is two different concept arts for the same skin.\n\nFor pronouns which was apparently a point of contention, idk why people are fighting over it when at the same time use pronouns for Star Wars robots and droids or even boats which has been done for generations.\n\nIn conclusion for me, Concord was another hero shooter, it had a few elements unique to its structure, it wasnt industry changing but nor did I expect it to be just as I do not expect any upcoming MMO to the a WoW killer or hard rival, just something more for us gamers to play and enjoy to provide variety to the market and Concord did that for me. Concord was its own take on the genre and I am very disappointed It didnt get the marketing it deserved. Like any game Concord wasnt for everyone, I have yet to find a game that is, its just a shame how we have to build factions of hate and ridicule around games and cheer when people lose their jobs and communities the game they enjoyed together. Not everyone who disliked Concord took part in this but I saw it in many places on the internet and it breaks my heart. I feel for anyone having to go through this with any game. Concord is not the first and wont be the last.\n\nI wish the developers and the Concord community the best. I enjoyed my time with you and I never wanted the forced Steam refund to come through. To me you deserved to keep the money even with my limited playtime. I clearly saw your hard work and dedication and on top of that a really awesome community rare to competitive multiplayer games. You guys rock, thank you for a great few weeks its been a pleasure and I'm so sad to see it end.",

The complete lack of marketing and the $40 price tag in a F2P world are definitely the biggest contributors to the flop, no question. But gameplay-wise, so far so good.\n\nI can't speak on the meta or competitive modes just yet, but gunplay feels like early Destiny pvp, and abilities complement the gunplay rather than being the main focus. Crew bonuses are an interesting quirk, haven't really played around with them too much but in theory it's a good concept to get people to try out different characters and strategies.\n\nIt's a hero shooter that doesn't really feel like a hero shooter, and puts gunplay at its core rather than abilities. Character design is absolutely hit or miss, I personally like the aesthetic but at the same time it's definitely \"Guardians of the Galaxy at home\".\n\nMatchmaking times have been pretty much fine, as the game has a healthier population on console and crossplay is enabled by default.\n\nDefinitely worth a shot if you've got the $40 lying around and some friends to play with, but I fully expect them to shift to F2P to try to save it sooner rather than later.",

It's (OW) great gameplay and unlockables kept us coming back and the (eventually added) voice lines and cinematics that made us fall in love. Concord at least has the game play part down.\r\n\r\nbut without the instant name brand of a marvel or starwars, a good progression system, or a main stay game mode to bring players in, plus plenty of bugs on my steam version, its hard to really recommend. \r\n\r\nwhich sucks, cause the devs. clearly have tuns of talent, the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing easy A+ work all around. \r\n\r\nso in summary, 7/10\r\n\r\n the game has all the potential to be great, but the negative impact of the social media bomb already has it on life support. buy only if you can afford to lose 40$ or if your desperate for a new hero shooter.\r\n\r\n",

The shooting is really tight and solid, each of the character kits work well with each other and really encourage team coordination (I also don't care at all about the character designs, they're fine and it's a first person game so you don't really see them anyway), and I just had a blast playing it. Sadly, I just don't think it's going to last very long and even though I like it and want to recommend it, I can't because it probably isn't going to last very long.

God of war, the last of us, all the spiderman, ratchet and clank, final fantasies etc. i figured if sony backed it, it would be quality. i found it to be. sucks theyre pulling it. i appreciated the game and wont forget it. thx firewalk and sony. i know the gaming space is crowded but i thought it could have its own lane. i had my own fun and thats my 2 cents.",

        "review": "I mainly play Concord on PlayStation, and have been having a blast. This is an old-school arena shooter with a unique crew bonus system that awards buffs for swapping to different characters and countering a rival team throughout the match. It gives you a deckbuilder/roguelike experience that feels very satisfying.\n\nAs someone who casually plays shooters, I appreciate everything about Concord. It brings me back to the feeling of playing Halo 2 back in the day\u2014that feeling of \"one more game\" is so strong here. \n\nAny character I switch to has been viable for me. I love the Crew Bonus system, as it incentivizes swapping characters during a match. Someone junking up the battlefield as Lark? I switch to 1-OFF and do some cleanup. And I get kills with 1-OFF, too.\n\nIt's a paid game, but this is exactly what we as gamers have been saying we want. A shooter that isn't nickel and diming you at every turn. A game that gives you a solid, balanced experience for players of all skill levels out of the gate on day one. And yet there's a very high skill ceiling for players to refine their own style using the crew bonus buffs and understanding each's strengths throughout a match.\n\nThey botched the reveal. They didn't explain why Concord is unique. But give it a chance and you will find an absolute gem. I enjoy it so much I bought it on Steam to show my appreciation for such an amazing game.",

If you have been on the internet I'm sure you have noticed that finding someone who has played the game with an unbiased opinion is fairly difficult. My recommendation is that you play the game for yourself.

These people are by their own definition 'Snowflakes' because they did not like a game that was being inclusive. They ignored the game-play and went and targeted the devs being rude and harsh just because it did not also match their conservative view\n\n\nCould this game done better if it was F2P? 100% \n\nBut the narrow view of other PC Gamers would only bring it down.\n\nIf they ignored all the things that annoyed them then they would see the game for what it was. A fun shooter with characters and good well designed maps. \n\nIDC if people give me clown awards on Steam.",

It's also a must to stick together as a team, doing that it's almost a guaranteed win.\r\n\r\nIf you think your character's too slow, recoil isn't good, reload speed too slow etc - look for any character with these perks and you'll be unstoppable with your fave after!\r\n\r\nI know it's cool to hate on this game for some reason, but truly, don't knock it until you try it!",
