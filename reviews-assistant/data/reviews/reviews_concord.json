And they are weekly timegated so the whole crew building doesn't really work when you have a 12 crew system with 4 backups. \n\nThe game is slow and clunky even with the movement buff. Only having a toggle dash is criminal on PC for keyboard. There are also no ways to turn off all these exp messages, quest pop-ups, etc. There is a lot of clutter on the screen with no setting to turn them off. The crosshair is follow-recoil and also has no way to turn it on static. \n\nThe game is not simply not feature complete at launch and doesn't run well on PC. Not worth the $40 asking price.",

There's not much to say about the shooting other than it's slow but sufficient and polished enough to be an F2P shooter game (oh wait).\r\n\r\nThen you have the non-existent balance where hero picks only matter because of the gun they use if you're lucky enough the other team has something that can't avoid your shots and how many times you feed to get a really useless team buff. then you have -narrow corridor with chokepoint 1 through 6- as maps and finally, you have the 3? 5? 6? barebones and completely uninspired game modes that all play the exact same.\r\n\r\nThat's just a recipe for a game with the 100 concurrent players there are now. I'm kind of surprised no one saw this coming in the 8 years it supposedly took to develop Concord but hey, here we are.\r\n\r\nBut if you are not just in for the gameplay but for A GAME, exciting scenarios or characters, bad luck. You'll have to deal with the cast of bland characters with annoying poses, voicelines, no uniqueness or interesting abilities and the most tryhard \"inclusive\" roster of all that doesn't show anything inclusive AT ALL, it screams at every poorly designed element: \"PLEASE GIVE US MONEY! WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE, WHATEVER IT IS\".\r\n\r\n9 skins per character that all look the same, No matchmaking (because no players), 90s QOL stuff like knowing the name and character a teammate is playing by just pressing tab, the whole match lagging when 1 person has a high ping, ZERO options to communicate besides voice, onetrick players who are pretty much encouraged to leave to get their character. I don't even know what else to put here out of so many wrong things.\r\n\r\nThis game should be in the training manual for every game developer. This is 'how to be obvious when trying to exploit modern audiences', 'how to create something that already exists, but worse', 'how to charge \u20ac40 for a game that is like the free ones but with less content'\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and play ANY other game, even the hated F2P hero shooters are a million times better in almost every aspect, this has UE5 graphics which usually look good at the very least just to finish on a good note.",

It feels like for every step where the designers clearly put a lot of love and effort, there's equal parts that feel undercooked or just straight missing. \n\nThe game wants to have that GotG type of camaraderie with the cast but you're only given little bits of info on the characters from the little cutscenes and the lore area. I think the cast of characters could have been a fun dynamic group but they just throw a bunch of people into a room and the only premise you're given is \"here you go, a bunch of people\" and you only get to learn about their personalities through small conversations and, I guess, their chatter while playing the game?\n\nI genuinely think this game would have done much better if it were a PVE game, not a PVP hero shooter. If they made something like Eidos' GotG game but as a co-op first person shooter it could have stuck out a lot more. But as it is, I don't think this game will survive very long. It was already difficult to find a game on launch day, and that will only get worse as time goes on. \n\nI like the feel of the gameplay, but when Destiny 2 and Overwatch are free - despite how much I don't care for those games - it's hard to justify dropping $40. I see a potential future for this game if they are able to pivot to a free model. As it is though, I requested a refund. I see the effort in the places where it shines but I didn't love the overall package enough.",

The game is more akin to Lawbreakers than Overwatch, for better or worse. The visuals play a part in the sour reception of this game, but the game severely lacks a reason to keep coming back for more. \n\nLack of gameplay modes is the cardinal sin. At launch, you\u2019ve got your TDM game modes, area control game modes, and no respawn game modes. Two variations in each. \n\nIn TDM, some characters feel near useless, particularly the tanks. They are slow, clunky, and have no actual objective to anchor themselves around. Similarly, healers are quite underpowered in this game mode as well. \n\nArea control modes feel like you\u2019re playing discount Call of Duty and do not last long enough. Most games are frustrating one sided matches that end in mere minutes. \n\nThe best game mode, the no respawn mode named Rivalry, is the least played, sometimes leading to queue times of over 7 minutes for me. In this mode, the games\u2019s class balance and unique mechanics actually have time to shine. Too bad the tiny community isn\u2019t supporting it. \n\nDeployables persisting between rounds and even character changes is a really interesting concept. The role buff system that rewards you for swapping between character roles leads to interesting, although I worry shallow, decision making when choosing characters. The currently under utilized crew system that limits your character selection also has potential. But that\u2019s just it. This all has potential that isnt fully realized in a fully released game.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear the Concord devs have held back content for the sake of trickle releasing it over the coming months. The problem is they failed to captivate an audience out of the gate, so the product feels incomplete and is just one more issue to throw onto the pile of disappointment. \n\nConcord isn\u2019t a terrible game, but it has done very little to entice people to play it. Characters are fun to play, but lack game modes to really shine in. With a divisive visual style and a lack of a defining game mode, Concord fails to lure in an audience, and I\u2019m not sure it can recover at this point. Multiplayer games live and die by their player base, and let\u2019s just say there almost isn\u2019t a player base for Concord.",

You basically CANNOT strafe side to side(as you would in any other shooter), this would be okay if I was playing a heavy class but I was not.\nThe game as you already know features a very diverse roster of characters, and guess what, they all suck.\nAbilities range from FRAG Grenades to BEACONS that DEBUFF OR BUFF YOU(very inovative, or not) most are poorly implemented, if you want to win, shoot the red outline of the gadget. That's called winning baby. BOO.\nSomeone says the gunplay is good, they're either off some pill(highly likely) or they are delusional beyond saving(highly likely), it's nothing special, very basic, you'd think the animations for the various alien weapons would be atleast somewhat fun, creative or satisfying. No.\nAs you may have guessed not even game balance was properly worked on, you will be shooting a light class 4 times in the head from a revolver and not killing, what happened to rewarding a high risk and high skill ceiling gameplay?\nThe devs are so innovative and progressive that they didn't even think to ADD a game chat. Something might suggest to you that a game chat in a TEAMPLAY ORIENTED HERO SHOOTER would be very useful, devs disagree, words hurt and game chats aren't allowed in 2024, deal with it. There is a voice chat, that no one will ever use.

How can anyone recommend a game that's just \"good\" in a space that has titles that have pretty much perfected the genre at this point.\n\nTo think of all the smaller indie titles that could have been made with this budget that would have at least tried something original.

Did this need to take 8 years to develop? No. It feels like a game that would have been a 7/8 about a decade ago but now is a symbol of how stagnant the industry has become. And while I can't totally disagree with that sentiment, there was a solid game here, if nothing that would set the world on fire. \n\nSony and the rest need to stop spending hundreds of millions on the \"Games as a service\" model for every single genre of game. Game budgets are getting out of control and failure is just getting more and more expensive. We don't want you to play it safe, we want you to scale back these gargantuan rehashes of the same formulas to a level where you can actually maintain them if the player-base doesn't hit 50k concurrent players in the first week of it's life. All of the marketing and CGI promos won't save a game if the audience can get a similar experience elsewhere for cheaper. If this had shipped with any sort of substantial offline content, Sony probably wouldn't be in this mess right now.\n\nAll that being said, I wish Firewalk studios luck with whatever happens next. Regardless of how mismanaged this project was, there is genuine talent there, and it shows despite it's flaws.",

It's extremely unoptimized (averaging 30-40 fps on a 7900 XTX w/ 64GB of RAM, & on NVME).\n\nEven if you can get past the performance issues, the game has MAJOR balancing issues between its heroes. For example, Flark's gun is a complete abomination of a weapon that shoots floaty projectiles that do almost nothing for damage, whereas some other characters are running around one-tapping with their weapons. The time-to-kill ratio is VERY fast. For it to be this fast in a hero shooter, there *has* to be some modicum of health regen! Health pickups throughout maps are few and far between. Class-based systems are not emphasized ('Oh, big guy? Must be a tank. Oh, little guy with assault rifle? Must be a DPS...Wait, healer? healer?') You're kind of just left guessing about what to even do or how to strategize (Ironically, the game's training mode is quite enjoyable).\n\nIt's 2 core game modes to boot are a standard TDM and Area Control, which is basically Domination? Not bad game modes per se, just not something you would expect from this kind of game. This is something you see in a game like Rogue Company from Hi-Rez, which is completely free to play (and this is a $40-$60 title).\n\nIt's a shame because this game's design is fairly charming, almost feels like a Guardians of the Galaxy meets Overwatch type of hero shooter, but....it's riddled with technical issues that keep it from reaching its full potential.\n\nMaybe they'll turn it around? idk, but where it currently sits from a developmental standpoint, it seems like its A LOT to ask for. Feels like I played a really early access title.",

        "review": "Do not buy this game until they fix it. Even then its not worth 40 dollars in its current state. \r\n\r\nThe main issue with this game right now is the performance. If you are lucky enough to get past the PSN login popup then you will be gifted non stop lag spikes and your computer will feel like it's on its last leg. Turn a corner and see an enemy -> game freeze -> unfreeze -> you're dead. If you're lucky it will only freeze for a second and you somehow survived. There's times it will freeze for 3 seconds and you're just waiting to be able to move again. Most likely you're dead. On top of that your whole computer will be slower while playing this game until you restart. And then on top of all that you'll most likely run into fatal crash errors every once in a while. \r\n\r\nIf they somehow fix all that...\r\n\r\nOverall the gameplay is decently fun, though repetitive. There are 3 playlists, one is basically TDM, the second is basically domination, and the third is their best playlist where you have to capture a bomb and planet it on a site and each player only has one life per round. It encourages teamwork and strategy which this game desperately needs. But that's it. That is all there is to this game. There's nothing worth grinding for. The cosmetics are all super basic and lazy. There are \"variants\" of some heroes that advertise changing how they play but they really do not.. Most likely if you were able to do random variants on heroes you wouldn't know which variant you are playing from one game to the next. They barely change anything. Some heroes could use some tweaking to make them more balanced. Most likely you'll find 3 or so characters you enjoy to play and then the rest of the roster will feel pointless to play because they just aren't as good. But player balancing can be fixed. The graphics are really good, and the UI is solid. That's about as far as it goes unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe 40 dollar price tag is kind of insulting honestly. I'm all for buy-to-play if that's what a game wants to do but at least respect us and give us something for our money. The fact Overwatch is free and this is 40 dollars is truly insane. You get better unlocks in the free tier of the Overwatch battle pass than you do in all of Concord. Each character only has 1 skin variant that isn't a recolor and even those are MOSTLY recolors, only altering maybe a hat or a belt or something. Or they look just awful all together. I just KNOW a paid store is coming which will offer better items than what we got as a thank you for supporting this game on day one. Not to mention, looking at this current player count i'm betting this will go free-to-play within 2 months tops.\r\n\r\nI honestly wish the game success cause when the gameplay feels good it is a good time. But I just don't understand how this game was released in this state and we had to pay for it. It truly makes no sense. Wait for this game to be free. Don't support this type of effort with your money. We as consumers deserve better from these big companies who are just serving us the bare minimum.",

        "review": "As a Destiny 2 Crucible player, there are many things I like about Concord, yet I cannot in good consciousness leave a positive review due to some fundamental issues with the launch version of the game.\r\n\r\nFirst, the obvious problem is a lack of players. This means when you do find a game, you will most likely find the same players. There can be no doubt that Concord has really clicked for a dozen of players, which you will find out, when your entire team of level 2 accounts blindly rushes into the open, to get absolutely destroyed in seconds. I suppose the only upside of the long queue times, is that by the time people actually get into a game, the Steam refund window will be closed.\r\n\r\nMany reviewers have already commented on the bland character designs, which is very disappointing considering the rich worldbuilding, gorgeous environments and Bungie skyboxes. I am willing to bet my Canadian pesos that if you show a random person a picture of Teo, they would be hard pressed to tell you which game he's from. The character design is not just a failure in an aesthetic sense: given that many of the crucial roles are so visually unappealing, in random games (the only ones you can currently play due to the aforementioned lack of players) everyone will lock down the same 4 or 5 characters, which results in poor team compositions. Now I am not saying that every game needs anime waifus, but it is very important to make support and tank characters visually appealing, so that people would want to pick them. Meanwhile, players will be wondering how the hell Daw passed military qualification, lock down Star Child, and then rush into a chokepoint to get instantly obliterated.\r\n\r\nFor a $40 game, the customisation is simply not there. Each character will have 5-6 recolours, and a low-effort legendary skin that will often be somehow worse than the default outfit. For a game with such high production values, it is puzzling that the developers have spent no effort on making cosmetics unlocks visually-appealing. By comparison, if you were to spend that money on a couple of season passes for the Free-to-Play games Concord is attempting to compete with, you will end up with a bunch of outrageous, distinct outfits that probably play the sad whale song each time you score a kill.\r\n\r\nIn Concord, you can unlock variants of the 16 classes through five sets of objectives, with some variants being significantly stronger than the starting loadouts. I am definitely not a fan of this system, and it feels like a cheap way to add unlockables instead of designing a comprehensive loadout system: some guns just don't feel great, and it would be great to have some gear customisation options, instead of avoiding a character because their one weapon sucks. Yes, I get the game balance angle, but surely Concord have enough combined experience making PVP games to balance about 18 different guns!\r\n\r\nThe gunplay is mostly satisfying, some maps are quite good, and there is a lot of good game design, which makes Concord encounters interesting and enjoyable. Nonetheless, with all these issues, I just can't recommend the game and, by the time you read this review, the game will simply not have enough players to be worth saving. Also, and this can't be stressed enough, this game took 8 years to make. WHY??",

What are we doing here?!\n\nWhen this game first released in Beta, I had a great time with it besides the bugs happening..the game releases and THE SAME BUGS are happening AND MORE! Random fatal crash errors which happens about two times a day? Then the random freezing multiple times throughout the matches is INSANE! It's not anyone's PC cause it's happening to EVERYONE! PLEASE for the LOVE OF GOD FIX THE SERVERS!\n\nYou guys want your game to work? Make it FREE and bring out some EPIC SKINS! We're all dumb, WE WILL PAY FOR THEM! The road map you guys have and Season 1 not starting until October needs to start now if you guys don't want to lose your player base. You guys need to grab more people and grab them quick cause once people lose interest, you're done for.  There are way better games out there for free that offer so much more. Make us WANT to play YOUR GAME!\n\nThe unlocks are just the same skins but different colors? We're putting so much time into this game for what? Give us something to play for..give us something to EARN! WE LOVE REWARDS!!\n\nI'm really rooting for you guys and I hope this game becomes something special because I love it, I really do. I paid the price($60) and I don't want a refund. I just want a polished game that is complete and a player base where you're not sitting for minutes on end trying to search for a match. I feel like a lab rat playing a game that's still in the alpha phase most of the time.\n\nI don't ever write reviews but I really hope you guys see this and make some changes.  Don't give up on the game, just make the right choices and changes that need to be done. I will continue to play this unfinished game you overcharged for and hope for the best.\n\n<3 to all the Freegunners, see you out there.",

        "review": "I have put in a refund request.\r\nI would like to state the fact that there were lots of talented hard working people who contributed to this game over almost a decade and a lot of their work is great, however a lot of it also deserves criticism.\r\n\r\nWith that being said however, let's start with the gameplay of Concord. \r\nThe base game is fun, as is basically any other arena shooter. The gun play is good, hit registration seemed fine and the levels felt well designed. The hero abilities are fine as well with some actually unique ones that do spice up the gameplay a bit. It does rely a bit on teamwork and while that does make sense, expecting randoms to cooperate with you is like expecting Sony to make good financial decisions. There are a few modes, but don't expect to play all of them because of the lack of players. \r\nWhile the basics are good and it's a pretty fun game, I don't see why anyone would pay 40$ when they can get this experience, likely more fully fledged, by playing something else. It's a fun but generic game. OK is the word that best describes it, maybe in a slight apathetic tone. It doesn't expand on anything, nothing here feels brand new, just generic fine hero shooter pvp with a Guardians of The Galaxy theme slapped on it (focus on the word \"slapped\" as it feels like a copy but more on that a bit later). There are variants and lots of little things that impact the gameplay that feel like slightly more fleshed out elements from other games but ultimately I was not interested enough to dive deep into them since the basic gameplay would still be basic even with a small bonus. \r\n \r\nHero design is up next. This is obviously subjective but I am quite mixed to say the least on them. \r\nI liked a few of the characters such as it-Z, Lennox, Roka and Kyps but even some of these ones feel generic and look like assets bought off the market place with a coat of paint added on top. Lennox is literally alien humanoid with revolver, Roka looks like a mobile game astrounaut and Kyps is a Chat GPT prompt that reads \"mannequin saul goodman cyberpunk\" with the personality of my smart washing machine. \r\nThe rest are deplorable. \r\n- A literal trashcan that made me burst out laughing everytime I saw it on the battlefield (and trashcan is putting it lightly that thing is bigger than some houses).\r\n- A discord moderator with ski glasses and cleaning gloves \r\n- A hazard suit cleaning lady. \r\n- A Mukbang youtuber in military grade armor that looks like an alien turtle from afar. \r\n- A basic soldier with nothing special. Soldier 7 because he is not special enough to get more than that. \r\nAnd the rest that I am not mentioning because reviews have character limits. \r\n\r\nLive service is ironically something this game doesn't fail at (In theory). It costs 40$ but you can progress and get lots of stuff for free, there is not fortnite battle pass, no fomo, no daily log in mobile game engagement tactics. It is actually very refreshing. Props for that, but sadly it's not working out at all. The playercount is lower than my shoesize at launchday and I don't expect a huge resurgence unless it goes free to play and even then, hopium is all there is. Chasing a trend and delivering said product based on that trend 8 whole years later doesn't work, surprise surprise. \r\n\r\nOverall, while the graphics looks good, the artstyle is fine and the basic gameplay is generically fun, the game fails to deliver anything unique to convince people to spend single player money for something that is free everywhere else. The heroes, with a few exceptions, are simply boring or ridicolous (seriously that trashcan is just funny at this point). \r\n \r\nNot recommended unless there are major reworks to the designs with a new monetization model with something fresh. I did not even mention the story in this review as I found it to be the most generic disney rated 3+ story in history and did not bother with it (shame because they spent a lot of time and money on full on CGI cutscenes every week or something like that). \r\nIf somehow they go F2P and convince more people to hop on, I would give it another try since the gameplay was fun. Generic fun, but still fun. \r\n",

Maps have a decent layout but far too large, and lack any kind of visual variety. Abilities lack any punch.\n\n8 years to develop 16 characters and 4 maps seems crazy, but considering the live service nature and the amount of useless job roles in AAA, that drain the budget and add nothing to the game, I can see how the game ended up in this state.

This game is pretty fun in terms of actual game play, but there are some aspects that are lacking, such as any sort of progression, or a sense of direction and knowing where this game is headed. There is not much to do in the menus except read narrative, which is like... 0-0 ok thanks for that info, what else can I do while I wait for my game? OH! I can unlock different shades of the same skin! YAY. And lets not forget that some of the characters (not all) are hard to look at sometimes. Lennox looks cursed af. 0_0\n\nAnother critique would be the game modes, although they feel a bit off, with the games being a bit one sided at times, it seems like this game is meant to be a team oriented game, but the game modes don't support that narrative. I was expecting some overwatch style game modes initially but to my surprise it was more like COD. \n\nTHE PRICEPOINT.  with the 40 dollar pricepoint and the current look of the economy, people are going to expect more for what they are paying for, and this game feels like a its a bit short as well as the current (and future) market for competitive hero shooters \n\nThe pronoun stuff doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you either. \n\nThis game does have some great qualities that could help with gaming overall, considering the game does not have any microtransactions, and you unlock new things through playing the game, but at the same time I feel like theres nothing to progress towards. \n\nMaybe that'll change, maybe they will listen to the critiques, Because there are a significant amount of people stating that this game could be great if a few, but MAJOR changes happened,  it could get people on board. Hopefully this game gets some support considering the bad launch, because this game could be good if they do this right.",

If it was free to play it would be an alright game, but if you're planning on releasing something like this, you're better off following the trend of free to play and relying on cosmetic profits. I wanted to give a better chance but due to steams strict refund policy I couldn't be bothered. \nThe gunplay and characters seemed fun, but the lack of ultimates made each character lack a lot of flash they could have had. Game modes were scarce and closer to that of a Call of Duty play list instead of a hero shooter which was odd. TDM and Domination was all there was to it until a certain level. \nTo top it off, the games performance was wildly inconsistent. Without V-Sync I experienced severe screen tearing, with it on the game ran awkwardly chunky. I have a 6800 XT and R7 5800X3D Procecessor and run any other game fine so it feels they put very little effort into PC performance testing. \nHope they reconsider their current model to push this game into an alright spot, a bit of work and change in price could make it more approachable. \n",

Perhaps made for less skilled gamers (which on the surface is fine)\n- not enough variation. The game modes available would get stale after a while. The cut scenes, while nicely rendered are pretty pointless not affecting the overall gameplay. It's a nice lick of paint on an entry level car\n\nThe gaming community critics are right - it should be free to play. Even in Sony squandered 100 million on it (which I somewhat wonder if this is true because it has an indie level game feel at times), they're not going to recoup their losses and it's not going to find the community it so desperately needs.\n\nMake it free and let the modders turn it into Unreal Tournament 99 remake (which it almost feels like at times - that's a positive), and then it might save this lumbering beast of a failure.\n\nA failure with potential, I should add. It did seem fun in places but yes I ultimately refunded because I value my $60 AUD.\n\nLastly I should add, I'm running it on an RTX 2060 and had to have it on lowest settings, frame rate dipped a lot - that could be on me cause I was trying to stream it for the short time I played it which took away from some CPU usage, but it is potentially fairly hardware intensive.",

Don't waste your time or money.\n\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this dumpster fire of a game called \"Concord.\" First off, why on earth is it named \"Concord\"? I thought I was going to be playing some cool game involving the legendary Concorde plane, but no! It's just some trashy, low-effort, knock-off clone of Overwatch and Team Fortress 2. Not only does it fail at capturing the magic of either game, but it somehow manages to be worse in every possible way.\n\nThe gameplay? Clunky and broken. The characters? Bland, uninspired, and awkward rip-offs of heroes we've seen a million times before. The graphics? Laughably bad, like something from a decade ago, and not in a charming retro way\u2014more like a \"this should have been left in the garbage bin of history\" way.\n\nHow this game is mostly positive on reviews is beyond me. Are people playing the same game I am? Because this thing feels like it was slapped together by a group of interns who have never played a shooter in their life. Every minute of playing \"Concord\" feels like a chore, and honestly, nobody should have to pay for this garbage. It's borderline robbery.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs. If you want to play a great team-based shooter, go play the games this one tried and failed to copy. \"Concord\" is an absolute disgrace to gaming, and the only thing it has in common with the plane is that it crashes\u2014hard.",

        "review": "After spending about 7 hours with Concord, my feelings are mixed. The emphasis on a $40 live-service model feels risky, making it a tough sell for most players. The game is short on modes, and the ones available lack inspiration. Matches often feel decided within the first minute, with few options to turn the tide. While not every hero shooter needs an Ultimate ability, Concord desperately needs a system or mechanic to make matches more engaging.\n\nThe game's approach to lore, with its supposed weekly cutscenes, is puzzling. The opening cinematic fails to make you care about or invest in any of the characters\u2014they just exist in a world that feels like a low-budget knockoff of the MCU, complete with poor characterization and mediocre writing that attempts to mimic the MCU's humor, which never really worked to begin with. Maybe it's my ADHD talking, but reading page after page of text in the Constellation section is one of the most boring and pointless lore systems I've encountered in a game. Lore is essential for a game developer to create a framework for a character or world, but simply dumping it into the game and expecting players to understand or care about it is baffling.\n\nWhere Concord shines is in its first-person shooter gameplay. It\u2019s fast, chaotic, and challenging. Despite some truly awful character designs, most of the characters play well and have distinct playstyles. For example, Teo appeals to those who enjoy Call of Duty-style FPS gameplay, while Kyps is all about stealth. There's a good variety in character gameplay, so most players will likely find someone they enjoy playing as.\n\nHowever, the level design is lackluster. If someone asked me to name my favorite level, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do much more than vaguely describe \"the one with the crates and the glowing thing in the middle.\" Hero shooters succeed when you become invested not just in the characters but in the levels as well. Remember how exciting it was in Overwatch to play on a mini Las Vegas level or a deserted cowboy western level? Concord has none of that. Its levels are bland and uninspired, all feeling fundamentally the same, even if the color palettes differ. Like the characters, the levels seem to just exist without any continuity in art style or memorable locations. They all blend together, making it difficult to learn or distinguish one level from another.\n\nMatchmaking is also concerning. While Steam data should be taken with a grain of salt, as of this writing, Concord hasn\u2019t even reached a peak of 1,000 players. Currently, only 248 people are playing on Steam. If you\u2019re on PC and want to play against other PC players only, you\u2019ll face match wait times of 5-10 minutes. You have to enable crossplay to fill player slots with PS5 players, but the low player count leads to matches where everyone has poor connections. From the recent players I\u2019ve fought, most were from the US, and since I\u2019m based in Europe, it results in a poor performance experience.\nOn PC, the game\u2019s performance is erratic. My 5900X with a 6800 XT GPU should be more than enough to run the game smoothly, but regardless of the settings, the game runs poorly, fluctuating between 150 FPS and 45 FPS within seconds. \n\nThe game is literally causing me motion sickness. I contacted Firewalk support, and they suggested that the issue might be related to region or server problems. Being in Europe, I\u2019m consistently matched with players from the US, which could be contributing to the game\u2019s sluggish performance.\n\nConcord isn\u2019t a bad game, but its pricing is way off for the market it\u2019s competing in. The game modes lack excitement, the characters struggle to be likable, and the level design is bland. However, it\u2019s a solid first-person multiplayer shooter with intense and occasionally excellent combat.\n\nGiven the low player interest, I can only recommend Concord to those who are okay with spending $40 and willing to take the risks mentioned here. I will continue to play Concord for at least a week or two, just to see where the game lands both with players but also to see how the completely nonsensical story might evolve.",

They are MOSTLY bland and not distinctive enough, let alone iconic and pop. There are very few ways and different modes to actually play the game.It's overall actually very shallow in depth and story...maybe this is to be expected from season 0 of a new game like this, but everyone expects more these days. \n\nYou can bind the arrow keys to whatever you want, but for some bizarre reason, they are HARD BOUND to just \"looking\". Crouch/sprint are toggle only with no options. PC players were clearly an afterthought.\n\nThe nail in the coffin? There were 100 Steam players on today and I tried matchmaking in two different modes at noon only to get timed out at 10mins. Once crossplay is on, you can get a match easy. So the only way you are going to play the game for the entire future is with PS5 players, which is fine, but not what we want. All in all I just feel bad for the hard working devs at Firewalk. I believe this project was GROSSLY mismanaged and I think most of the devs knew what was going to happen.\n\nIT-Z is kinda cute though :)",

Throw away npcs or trash mob designs in modern games have more going on then the rocket character does. Not only are they boring, dull, lifeless and designed by complete ametures, but they aren't even balanced. The DEI hires of the dev team gave eachother no criticism clearly and it shows as all aspects of the game are horribly designed. I can empty 2 full clips in to a heroes head, with perfect accuracy, just to get aoe splash damaged by a flying character who insta kills me in half the time with no aim. Regardless of team or skill level the highest frag hero gets 10-20 kills on their best game and average players get 2-5. You can't carry a bad team even if you're a pro, or have any affect if you can't get a strong hero. Most heroes just don't have enough in their kit to help the team as the spy character you get 2 grenades which have cooldown for some reason which just gets rid of the map and abilities for 2 seconds while the classic soldier hero gets non cool down very strong explosion grenades which have 4 slots and refill on kill. \n\nThe hero designs, pronouns, modes, maps, nothing is well designed. It seems like between all the teams experience, its still less combined than a new group of community college interns at a indie gaming company. Look at deadlock or any other hero shooter and its as if this team was new to the genre and game design all together. \n\nTLDR worst designed characters of all time, even free to play this game would not be worth your time. People say make it free, I say delist it all together, gonna plat it before that inevitably happens. Wish me luck!",

        "review": "Edit: Mass refunds and a shut down in under a month. Wow\n\nTLDR: Game is a ton of fun but I can't recommend someone spend $40 on it at this moment. If the game is made free to play, or goes on a decent sale, I would recommend. \n\nElephant in the room, player count. People will cope and say queues are still fast but that is only because there is 0 SBMM and no region locking WITH crossplay default enabled. Even still the no respawn mode (Rivalry) has long queues at all times, sometimes nobody queuing it at all. Speaking of Rivalry, players throwing to quickly farm XP has been an issue since launch weekend and devs have done nothing to fix it, they've been silent post launch. This makes the mode only playable with a full stack, which will lead to you 4-0'ing every match, at least in my experience. Suffice it to say the playercount is a massive issue. While the numbers are for sure better on playstation, I have serious doubts that they would even be called good, I suspect there is sub 500 players online at any given time as of 2 weeks post launch.\n\nThis leaves the other 2 respawn queues, TDM/Kill Confirmed and Domination/Hardpoint. These are both fun and I enjoy both, but there are issues with these modes. TDM matches are always far too short, the kill count should be increased from 30 to 50. Kill Confirmed is actually great, I don't have a suggested change for it. Domination and Hardpoint are both balanced around constant contesting. 2 good teams will lead to long matches where both teams struggle to garner a significant lead. A missmatched lobby will lead to quick games with score gaps of 100+. When these games go the distance they are great fun. Unfortunately due to the lack of SBMM, no doubt further impacted by the low player count, these long high quality matches are not the norm.\n\nThe core gameplay here is fantastic. Destiny PVP but way better. People compare this to Overwatch a lot but it plays nothing like that. Healing for example is very slow, so fights can end very quickly despite the generally long TTK if you don't play with your team or stand in the open. There are so many small details here that are very clever and do a lot to make basic hero shooter mechanics more engaging. A quick example is how this game does ability recharging. Every ability is unique in this regard. Some are on a timer like normal, others require kills, others pickups, and others character specific things like getting a scan with a different ability and interacting with that again. There are tons of small twists like this on the standard multiplayer hero shooter formula and almost all of them are great changes. The best way to engage with these systems is in the Rivalry mode, especially the crew bonus system that rewards swapping characters, but unfortunately Rivalry is kind of ruined by previously mentioned issues. \n\nPeople really don't like the character designs. I'm probably 50/50 like/hate on the roster. I really like some of the character designs like Kyps and Jabali, but then there are huge stinkers like Daw and Bazz (although when you unlock different glasses for Bazz she is way better IMO). There is 0 sex appeal here, which I think is what has most people upset even though they would never admit it. Whether or not this matters a ton is is up to you. For me this is not a major issue, I play these kind of games for the gameplay and if it looked like Roblox with fancy lighting and effects I wouldn't really care. Aside from character models the game looks very good IMO. \n\nTech wise I've only had some infrequent crashing and small bugs. I am on a 4070ti Super with an AMD 7800x3D though so I can't really comment on performance. Runs good for me, might not on a worse setup.\n\nIm a Sci Fi guy, big on Star Wars pre Disney and I love Mass Effect. This games lore/world has a lot to like. You can read about an astonishing amount of things in the \"Galactic Guide\", essentially this games prettier version of the mass effect codex. Unfortunately there is no voice acting here so it is a lot of reading. Some sneak peeks here: The entire galaxy is slowly being consumed by something called the tempest, the pseudo galaxy government known as the guild is consuming the finite resources without having a plan for when they run out, and most of the food people eat are giant squid like creatures from another planet doused in grounded up egg goo that makes it taste good. People dismiss this mode, but I think its a great addition and its clear that a lot of effort has been put into this. Were this game to have a long lifespan (which I seriously doubt at this point) there would be so many cool ways for the story to go. You can also read this while you are in queue which is very nice.\n\nThere are also the weekly \"vignettes\" but both featured so far were also in the beta so this has been extremely underwhelming as of now. \n\nWith the $40 price tag some promises were made and there was also some automatic expectations. I have been overall disappointed with the value for my money when it comes to this. One thing that was promised thanks to the price tag was no paid battle pass, which is true come launch. Progression in this game is based on your account level and individual character level. Both account and character levels earn you separate rewards. Unfortunately a lot of the rewards you will be earning here are underwhelming. Trinkets seen as battle pass filler in other games still make their appearance here despite the lack of battlepass. Here they serve as progression filler so they can tell you there is a reward in the next few levels when all it ends up being is a weapon charm you probably won't even bother to equip. There are also a TON of re-colours.\n\nFurthermore a lot of the \"big\" rewards you will eventually earn like legendary skins kind of suck. Like the character designs, legendary skins are probably 50/50 good/bad. Emari's is great and fixes a character who I don't like the regular look of. Meanwhile Jabali's biggest change is some horns on his hat. Despite some of these underwhelming rewards levelling also takes a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. With 60 hours in the game as of writing (5 or so being afk or accidentally left on) I still do not have a single character at level 20, and multiple still not at level 10. My account level is only just 50, with the hardest achievement in the game being to reach account level 100. I have only seen one of these legendary skins in the wild during a match. Progression could be 2x as fast and I would still probably think its a bit slow, but that would be a great improvement.\n\nThere is a cosmetic shop coming with the season 1 patch scheduled for October (although we will see how this schedule holds given the games launch), and I will be very upset if a bunch of way cooler skins are added with it and nothing else is added to the games current progression.\n\nI don't regret buying the game, I expected to only get 2 months or so out of it as casual shooter game I could play on the side, but I didn't think the numbers would be THIS bad. I can't recommend a purchase in its current state unless devs come out with some sort of action plan. If it ever does go free or on a deep sale I highly recommend, because the actual game that is here is very good.",

It's hard to tell the exact cause but judging by the overly long wait times (1-2 mins minimum) and the fact that my ping is showing as low compared to everyone else in the lobbies, I'd place a bet in saying not only is the player base extremely low, but that the majority are based on NA servers.\n\nI'm hoping that upon full release later today a big wave of players will help iron out these matchmaking problems as I really just want to give the game a fair shot after I had a good amount of fun with the Beta. Here's hoping that others give the game a chance and in doing so creates a better experience for all of us currently facing matchmaking and latency issues.",

I finally bought it today on september 6!\nI played for roughly 4 hours and there is this cool feature where the game puts you in the same lobby with the same people all of the time. Searching for a game is a little bit long tho, probably to many players crashing the servers. Gaming in 2024, am i right? Haha!\n\nAnyway, I'm super excited for the future of this game!

        "review": "While the rough core of the game isnt bad and there is a semblence of a stable foundation, the game doesnt innovate and even is missing critical systems needed for a multiplayer game. In this rough shape and at this price, the game has a serious problem to get the attention of potentional players as its presentation is at best lukewarm and the gameplay lacks all common improvements present in the gaming scene in the past years. Due to various issues listed bellow, I cannot recommend this game at this current state and price. I personally will keep playing the game, but with these issues, I cannot recommend it.\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay[/b] \r\nThe core of the gameplay is present and if this is your first game of this type, it may feel fresh at first, but it is lacking larger and smaller QoL improvements. One of them is partial weapon reloads, there are too many instances where you can accidentaly interrupt the realoding animation and once you want to resume it, it begin from the start. A smaller QoL feature that is missing is Assist counting as kills, this is needed in high latency lobbies. The game gas a weird long time to kill, which I am personaly not fan of.\r\n\r\n[b]In-game communication[/b] \r\nThe game has a basic pinging system and an option to opt-in into voice chat at the start of the match and that is it. The game lacks a communication wheel to say simple commands to your team like \"Group up\", \"I need healing\" or even \"Thank you\". Chat is not present at all. This team oriented game has almost no ways how to communicate as a team.\r\n\r\n[b]Crew system[/b]\r\nI feel this system is at the core the cause of the character balance issues. Some characters are strong from the get go and these feel good to play. But other you first need to apply bonuses by playing different characters and by that time in the match, you have no assurance that the actual character you want to play isnt already taken (and there is no way to tell other players you want to switc to said character). Basicaly if you wan to play a strong character, you do not need to use the crew system. If you want to play a weaker character, you first need to switch trough various different characters to make the one you want to play less bad and you will still play worse than the good characters.\r\n\r\n[b]Game modes[/b]\r\nThe game has 3 playlists, Brawl, Overrun and Rivarly.\r\nBrawl consist of TDM and TDM+ (kill confirmed)\r\nOverrun consist of Capture the zones, and capture the moving zone\r\nRivalry is a no respawn gamemode, but I never got to play it.\r\n\r\nBrawl and Overrun plays the same and most people ignore the objectives in Overrun as there is no incentive from the game to play objectives. There is no Capture the Flag, no Paylod, no Push, no PvE, no Deathmatch.\r\n\r\n[b] Multiplayer and queue times[/b] \r\nAbout a week has passed since the release of the game and depending on the time of day, you may get a quick queue time in about 30 seconds, but if you are on PC and in the EU, you may experience queue times of 2 - 3 minutes even for the most played \"Brawl\" playlist. And if you get into a match, be prepared to be places into a high latency lobby. I wasnt able to get into \"Rivalry\" playlist as the queue times went above 6 minutes and I gave up.\r\n\r\n[b]Progression and unlocks[/b]\r\nMost progression objectives are a variation of number of kills, assist, damage done, rounds played, rounds won. The progression system has minimal teamwork oriented objectives and so far none related to capturing a zone or any tied more to the gamemodes.\r\n\r\nThe game doesnt show you what item you unlock at what level, it only shows what is the current item to be unlocked, but you have no idea if the next one is something \"\"\"interesting\"\"\" or another side bar color.\r\n\r\n[b] Characters (gameplay wise)[/b] \r\n16 characters and a lot of them feels unbalanced. You get strong characters that can stand on their own like Lennox and Haymar, and on the other end of the spectrum you get Jabali with his BB gun. The overall issue is that some characters have a really low damage output and if you are in a high latency lobby and experiencing high ping and lost packets, playing those characters is misery.\r\n\r\n[b]Characters (lore wise)[/b] \r\nThe game is unable to sell the personas of the characters to the players. There is no banter between characters at the start of the match that would tell you what the relation between each character is. So if you are not drawn in by the looks of the characters, there isnt much else to know about them. The only info you get is an entry which you get by leveling a character to level 3, but as of now, it only talks about their backstory.\r\n\r\n[b]Characters (visualy)[/b]\r\nMost of the characters designs feels like they need more iterations befoure they could be considered good. Some designs are just too much, like the design of Bazz would benefit from a streamlining.\r\n\r\n[b]Custom games[/b] \r\nThere is no option to host your own lobby.\r\n\r\n[b]Lore[/b] \r\nOne of the selling point of the game is its lore and how it is presented in the Galactic Guide. While the visual presentation is nice in a form of a galactic map, the game does a very poor job of connecting said lore to the gameplay. The lore set up the freegunners as oponnents to the Guild, but there is no hint of that in the gameplay at all as all is freegunners fighting each other.\r\nThe game has [b]vignetters (CGI shorts)[/b] which plays at the start of the game, but only the newest one plays and otherwise they are not present in the game at all and you need to do your own homework to find them.\r\nThere are also [b]Freegunners adventtures shorts (animated shorts)[/b] which are not in the game, there is no mention of them in the game and you need to be lucky to find them.\r\n\r\n",

If you like hero shooters, it might be your thing.\n I dont have an issue with it costing money, but since I don't have fun playing it, it's not my thing. The maps I did play felt slightly too large for 5v5 and yet small as well. I played 30 minutes, so I didn't try everything. Also theres some decently difficult players to play against already, so it has the potential. Anyways I didnt run into any bugs. Also the game modes are not interesting to me. There's counterstrike, zone control, deathmatch, practice and time trial. 3 of those I could not be less interested in. \nI hate to put it down because it plays well on day 1, I just found no joy in playing it.

No bugs to be seen, very surprising for a new game. The theme is Guardians of the Galaxy meets Overwatch, but the gameplay is fresh and interesting. I love the timed racing mode, it reminds me of Mirror's Edge parkour. More games should have skill trials like this. \n\nI'm sad to hear about Concord's early end. I guess people don't spend much money up front on multiplayer games since so many are F2P now. I don't blame anyone for saving money, but I guess we're stuck with loot boxes and virtual currencies forever. I hope Concord comes back with a F2P makeover so more people can see how fun it is.",

I do feel that you should wait for this game to get in its feet/ go on sale before buying it. As of right now it is fun but there is a whole lot of work that needs to be done before I am willing to purchase again. \n\nMain problem right now is it is glitchy during movement and you loose appeal for the game after 30 minutes of playing. My son and I were taking turns playing the game and after 15 minutes of him playing he asked me to turn the game off and play Fortnite or Overwatch with him instead. \n\nI understand this is DAY ONE but there is nothing to work for right now in the game( Nothing to Grid for). So the game feels boring after 1 hour.\n\nIn the coming months, I would like to see more character development, put in new loot that makes me want to grind the game, make character movement more fluid, and make it known what the developers are doing to keep the game fresh. \n\nI was rooting for this game and I still am. I just feel this is more of an early access instead of a fully developed game. \n\nThank you for reading my review/ Rant \n\nLove ThePoliteLife",

        "review": "Well I'd been playing this game nightly ever since it released, trying to earn the achievements and improve my skills with all the characters, only to come home and find out that Sony has given up on Concord three weeks in, as if it's failure wasn't largely their fault. This isn't the first time a niche FPS I like has bit the dust, see Hyperscape and the entire Titanfall franchise, but this one hurts a little more because this was the first Hero Shooter I ever really liked playing.\n\nThe failure of Concord comes down to a lot of intersecting factors but it is nevertheless shocking to see a game this feature complete with this much effort and lore put into it that is just gone, after less than 3 weeks. The announcement says they are exploring other options, like maybe a F2P relaunch, and I dearly hope that's true, but I'm not holding my breath. If more people had been willing to overlook the superficial deficiencies of this game I feel like a very interesting PVP sandbox would have emerged. Rivalry is one of the most interesting and well thought out gamemodes I have ever played in this type of shooter.\n\nAt the end of the day, Concord's failure to attract an audience can likely be attributed to the fact that in modern gaming, games are not given a chance to breathe, and must succeed immediately, combined with poor marketing and the fact that the FPS genre is one of the most impenetrable markets in gaming. Just about every permutation has a central pillar that any other challengers will always be in the shadow of. Cod,Overwatch,Fortnite,Apex, they have all locked down their parcels of land and it's been basically impossible for anything else to break out. The only thing that really sets Concord apart from the rest of the FPS graveyard at this point is the gap between the quality of this game and the magnitude of it's failure, which is surpassed maybe only by Titanfall 2, arguably the best example of a 10/10 FPS flop.\n\nSomeday I hope Concord returns and I can play it again, and that it finds an audience when it does. Until then, all I'll have are the experiences I had playing it. If and when it does come back, if you bothered to read this review for whatever reason, I hope you give it a shot. It might surprise you.",

        "review": "I will say that this game wasn't perfect and it did need some more work done to it. At first I didn't like the game but my brother loved it. So I kept playing with him every night after he got home from work and it slowly grew on me. We would always see the same people playing and be like \"oh shit it's that guy again!\" and try our best to beat them. One that stood out was a player named Milky Gluten and their buddy Shouty (I think that's how you say or write it). But they would lay us out about every time we went against them. We did beat them once or twice but my brother and I would bring them up when we were doing something else. He would say \"I bet they are 20+ Levels ahead of us now.\" or \"do you think we will see them today?\". When we did see them he would say \"lock in brother we got to beat them this time.\". GGs to both of you and you both were great opponents.\n\nI will wrap up this sob story now and say that I really did appreciate the time I spent on this game with my brother and I am sad that it is gone now. Not because the game is gone but that my brother is a little heartbroken over it being gone. He really did love the game to death. But we all have that game we love to death and hate to lose it. Mine was Battleborn and RE Operation Raccoon City which both weren't stellar games. I will end it here and say GGs to everyone who did play against my brother and I. \n\nThank you.",

        "review": "the game has fun gameplay with its characters and a lot of cool ideas, but the maps and modes on offer are a little slim for a 34.99 game in my opinion. also with the big focus on new weekly cutscenes about the characters they could have more than like 3 lines in matches you know??? maybe a dif line when you turn the shield into armour not just one lol. the game seemingly has no reflil players if someone rages or any kind of punishment which is pretty alarming for a game like this. personally its not with buying  with its player pool looking to go where its going right now, id say the game needs a retooling to a ftp model and maybe sell skins or something, the progression of unlocking gloves and recolours is not really doing anything for anyone, and the variants system is cool but badly implemented. i think there is something decent here somewhere but im puzzled in the way its presented and sold. id wait for a ftp relaunch or heavy discount but if thats the case will there be any players left. no new content till october!!!

        "review": "Leaving a review because I think the game and its devs are receiving a disproportionate amount of hate.\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Price[/b]: Single price tag and you can unlock all content including post-launch content. A lot of people understandably don't like that it's not F2P like other live service games. However, this way you're not getting pushed microtransactions via predatory tactics (e.g. P2W, loot box gambling and battle pass FOMO). It's worth considering on a sale if you find the price too steep.\n\t[*][b]First impressions[/b]: This game was written off by people ever since its reveal, it looked derivative, like a Guardians-themed Overwatch clone. It's a superficial judgement that I initially shared as well. I ended up trying the game and enjoyed it, but I'd imagine the internet echo chamber is making it difficult for others to do the same.\n\t[*][b]Characters[/b]: A common complaint is that the character designs are uninspiring and boring. I understand they're supposed to be a ragtag team of everyday people from the Concord universe, but I agree. They could've expanded on this with the character skins, but it's just comprised of basic palette swaps. This directly inhibits sense of progression as well, because they're rewarding you with these underwhelming skins.\n\t[*][b]Pronouns[/b]: The character selection screen includes pronouns for each character. A lot of people are [i]genuinely [/i]aggravated by this. It's not even prominently displayed - I didn't even notice the text until I saw all the comments about it.\n\t[*][b]Performance[/b]: It's pretty badly optimised. To get a stable framerate, I'm playing on DLSS Ultra Performance preset with everything set to low. It's crashed a couple times without any error messages, but is fortunately quite rare. There have been some performance patches already, but I expect it will take a while to fully iron things out.\n\t[*][b]Community feedback[/b]:  The devs listen to players; they addressed a lot of major issues reported in the beta by launch, which were about a month apart.\n\t[*][b]Match length[/b]: The matches are short and don't drag on, I'd say no more than 10 minutes. \n\t[*][b]Gameplay[/b]: Gunplay is solid. Abilities are simple to grasp and roles don't feel restrictive - healers can hold their own. I still don't have a main because I find each hero is fun enough to swap between, depending on the situation. There are no ultimates, probably to maintain pacing and avoid major game swings with a click of a button.\n\t[*][b]Strategy[/b]:[b] [/b]There's some strategy sprinkled in with the idea of variants, which encourages building your own roster with different passives, and switching between roles in-game to stack the relevant crew bonuses you'd need.\n\t[*][b]Audio[/b]: Very well done - SFX is satisfying and I can easily pinpoint where enemies are spatially (which is great if I could actually hit them afterwards)\n\t[*][b]Release date[/b]: This shared a release date with Black Myth, one of the most anticipated games of the year. This may have contributed to the lower numbers, but I'm not sure how much of a difference it would've actually made.\n\t[*][b]PSN account[/b]: It requires a PSN account, which isn't available everywhere. Some people don't trust Sony with their data or hate having to make another account. We're also coming right off the back of the Helldivers 2 controversy around this topic, which may have left a sour taste in people's mouths.\n\t[*][b]Crossplay[/b]: It's enabled by default and[b] should stay on[/b] for fast matchmaking. There aren't many PC players (there are dozens of us... dozens!)\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThe core gameplay is solid. The pricing method is a healthy thing for consumers. The devs are trying new things with a new IP - they seem like they have good intentions and listen to community feedback. There are performance issues on launch, but it looks it's currently being addressed.\n\n\nThere's a strange herd mentality praying for Concord's downfall, which feels unjustified because the studio hasn't really done anything [i]wrong[/i]. I hope it manages to survive, because I think this will ultimately hurt the kind of games we'll see in the future if it doesn't.\n\n\n",

I'm not sure if this a server side issue or an optimization issue.  alt+tabbing and doing anything on your PC at this point is almost impossible, you have to full restart.  so I think there is some kind of memory/vram leak?\n\nprogression is a joke.  most of the stuff you unlock in the game is just re-colors.  there are only 2 unique \"legendary\" skins IMO.\n\nno innovation on game modes.  rivalry mode is the most fun for me and the other 2 game modes are just boring\n\nlennox and haymar need to be nerfed or the other freerunners need to be buffed\n\nthe names of the characters are so stupid and annoying to remember, it's like they just asked chatgpt for the most random names and decided to stick with it\n\nscratching my head on how it took 8 years to make this game\n\nI don't care about the \"wokeness\" of the game, the game looks pretty and the gameplay is fun\n\nfirewalk at this point should just put out thousands of free keys to the game on their twitter because after a week this game is going to be fully dead, it won't even make it to season 1.  or do a couple free to play weekends leading up to season 1\n\neven if the game goes free to play at this point, I don't think there's any redemption here, sadly\n",
