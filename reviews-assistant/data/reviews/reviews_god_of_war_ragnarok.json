        "review": "to God of War: Ragnarok Dev. Team,\n\nI\u2019m writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the current PC port of God of War: Ragnarok that affects users with 4GB VRAM graphics cards. When attempting to launch the game on such systems, an error message is displayed, indicating that there is not enough VRAM, and the game closes without allowing users to proceed. It is my humble request to kindly reconsider or remove this VRAM limitation. From personal experience and community feedback, I can confirm that the game runs well on certain integrated graphics processors (such as the Ryzen 3 3200G, Ryzen 5 3400G, and Ryzen 7 5700G), which are generally weaker than many 4GB VRAM GPUs available today. God of War: Ragnarok performs on the base PlayStation 4, which further suggests that the game should be capable of running on 4GB VRAM graphics cards, and the latest Steam Hardware Survey shows that one of the most widely used graphics cards among gamers is the GTX 1650, which comes with 4GB of VRAM and is ranked within the top three most popular cards. Limiting access to such a significant portion of the player base can potentially prevent many from enjoying your incredible game. Removing or adjusting this VRAM limitation would greatly benefit the gaming community, ensuring that a larger audience can experience God of War: Ragnarok on PC!\n\nEDIT : there\u2019s a workaround and you can bypass this VRAM limit error by using a mod. ( MOD LINK : https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/12?tab=files ) To install it, just drag and drop the files into the game's root folder, and the game should launch without any issues. It's unclear why Jetpack Interactive locked out 4GB VRAM cards, especially since the game runs just fine on them!",

After navigating to the Playstation website and was routed through the problem FAQ's to contact customer service. Customer service connected me with a chatbot, which then got stuck in a loop informing me that customer service was not available at this time, despite being within operating hours, which it also provided. \n\nAfter several more attempts and an apparent alignment of supernatural forces, I was able to convince the chatbot to place me in the queue to live chat with an agent. At time of writing my position was well over 100 from being able to chat. All this to recover an account for a service I do not want, to play a game that I have purchased through a separate service. \n\nThis review will not change unless the PSN requirement is removed from the game.",

I finished this game already on my ps5 when it launched , but i'm mostly a pc player so having this in my collection is something that i really wanted. As for the pc port itself , the game runs very well , it's well optimised , i really don't mind the psn account as this was a playstation exclusive game . The story is great, the gameplay is amazing , there's plenty of secrets with a large area to explore . 10/10 game for me.",

I did not stumble upon any big issues regarding that, if I don't count one boat floating in the air lmao. I had chills playing this game from the first minute, I can't wait what's ahead of me and these negative reviews should not make you reconsider buying the game. Trust me, if you liked the first one, you will love the second one:) I do not regret paying 60 euros for such a gem. Now go have fun with it!!",

        "review": "This is probably the best game behind Elden Ring to come out of 2022. I loved the first game and super keen to play this once I got it. There is a lot for me to say so if you\u2019re looking for a shorter review the TDLR is: JUST GET IT AND PLAY IT. \r\n\r\nThe story-telling in this game is top tier. I understand why it was contender for Game Of The Year. There were tons of emotional moments in this game, some even made me shed tears. Kratos, behind that stoic, tough exterior shows more emotion, makes him feel more human rather god. And Atreus still learning, growing but to finally make his own choices, to be a man. The cinematic cutscenes were just simply S tier. I loved the story of this game and how much it has built upon the previous. It is one of those games where it feels like a great movie and game all in one.  \r\n\r\nSanta Monica Studios nailed the world-building of this game. They built upon the first game and often quote the events of the first game and the older games which deepens the overall lore significantly. I do not believe there is a single bad character in this game. They are all well written, well acted and they all interact with each other so well. Every character has well-written stakes in the conflict and that just makes the finale so much more impactful. \r\n\r\nThe side quests are just amazing in this game, though not all of them but most of them. They add upon the world, the characters and their history with one another, and they have important dialogue and all of which just aided me to have a deeper connection to the characters and the world. Side quest bosses and the End-game bosses just add a fun challenge to the game as well. \r\n\r\nThe combat is fun, its simple, easy to understand and satisfying. I loved creating my own combos in my head and seeing it pan out when I tried it. There is a diverse amount of special abilities to add to the weapons and there is no right answer to defeating the hardest bosses, you could just pick your poison and go at em. Moreover, the diverse range of builds with the armor, relics and gems only deepen the combat which is always great.\r\n\r\nMost of the negatives I have of the game are just nit-picks. I did not enjoy the UI and the Map, I felt like the UI could have been simplified to make it easier to navigate. The map was just hard to use, it was difficult to see which is the right path to take and it barely zooms in to see any details. Lastly, Atreus combat was too easy, even on the harder difficulty which often led to the parts where you controlled him felt like they were dragging. \r\n\r\nOverall, I loved this game, it was difficult to put it down even after finishing the game to 100%. A definite recommend to buy.",

At first I didn't care having to create a PSN account, since in my region it is available. Anyway as soon as I started the game and had to log in to said PSN account it kept infinitely looping between me having to sign in and the default screen where you can either continue to the sighn-in page or quit the game. Any actions in trying to repair the files and re-installing the game have unfortunately failed. The PSN support, if you can call it that has also failed to provide a feasible solution. Only stating that it should work after the file verification.\n\nSo I chose to refund this product which leaves me disappointed, since I was looking forward to playing this game.

Looks incredible and features once again brilliant, heartfelt voice acting (and mocap). Exceptionally well crafted environments and realms make exploration so fun, especially with the way they evolve throughout the story. \nCombat is as satisfying, brutal and rewarding as ever with some truly breathtaking boss fights. \nAn undeniably superlative experience.",

It's fine if you do not like the game, but please do not spread misinformation. I decided to purchase the game despite the complaints since I can always refund if I have problems. So far, my experience has been amazing. To clear misinformation, please see below:\n\n1. Playstation Network Account is required.\n\nThis just isn't true. There is an option at the main menu to sign into the Playstation Network, but is completely optional. Select New Game to start. There is a notice on the Steam page which states a Playstation Network Account is required, not sure why, but it isn't. I have started my game without signing in.\n\n2. Performance Issues.\n\nI am a few hours in with 0 performance issues. I have a base 4070, 32GBs of DDR4, and a Ryzen 3900x. I play on Ultra at 1440p. I did upgrade to the latest drivers and allowed my shaders to compile before starting the game. I have noticed if you exit out of the game and jump back in later you will need to compile your shaders again. If you do not allow the shaders to compile, you will experience severe lag and stutters. It is VERY obvious your shaders are compiling because in the bottom right of your screen it shows the progress. I assume players with performance issues are allowing their shaders to compile, but based on all the reviews, it wouldn't surprise me if they just hop in the game without compiling, see the lag, quit out, and review bomb.\n\nHopefully this review helped with the misinformation.\n",

        "review": "God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is a one of a kind, unforgettable experience/journey. It is a direct sequel to 2018's Santa Monica's - God of War which won GOTY. I have played every single GOW game to 100% completion and the story of Kratos is unforgettable. From his origin to now, with his son Atreus, who also goes by the name of \"Loki\". \n\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition of GOW:R for my PS5 and, to this date, I do not regret a thing because this is what a story game (and collectors edition) should be like. \n\nBelow I will tell you why GOW:R is an unforgettable experience and I will also share my thoughts and opinions on the game but before I get into anything, a quick disclaimer below!!\n\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \n\n[h1][b] PSN REQUIRMENT/The only Con[/b][/h1] \nSo I just want to start off by saying that the game does indeed require a PSN account to play the game which baffles me a little. Why does a SINGLE-PLAYER game require a THIRD-PARTY account to play on STEAM - the platform it is being launched on. \n\nNow, I do not mind to much personally because I own a PSN account but to the thousands of gamers/players out there that only use PC... Sony... you need to re-think this requirement because you are forcing players to make an account with your services to BOOST your \"apparent\" - players that own a PS console. \n\nEnough of this - now on to the review!!\n\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \n\u26abThe story is unforgettable. (no spoilers!!!)\n\u26abNot a single issue running the game at all. No freezing, stuttering, FPS drops... NOTHING. This is an unbelievable PC port. Bloodborne next?!?! Sony? Please?!!!\n\u26abThe combat is so damn fluent just like 2018's GOW! Throwing your leviathan axe, turning it to ice for more damage, the catch for recalling it is just so smooth. The parrying is skillbased and very rewarding as you can punish your foes witth a slew of different combos and then you have your blocking which you can pull a full 180 turn to cover your rear in combat showing Kratos's Spartan reflexes.\n\u26abThe boss fights... are just amazing. Figthing Thor, the god of thunder at tge start of the game was an absolute thrill ride to begin our epic journey across these realms. (only one I'm going to mention!!)\n\u26abFighting giant mythological mini-boss's that are extremely punishing on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR difficulty and the vast array of enemies in the game will have you perfecting your combat prowess from start to finish. \n\u26abThe soundtrack is gorgeous!! I love it!\n\u26abChristopher Judge and Sunny Suljic really bring Kratos and Atreus to life and we all know the \"BOY\" statement by now! That's not all, Freya is voiced by the talented Danielle Bisutti and Thor who is voiced by Ryan Hurst (known for Sons of Anarchy or The Walking Dead's Omega).\n\u26abThere is tonnes of lore, collectables and hidden little areas for you to explore! Remnants for one and Odins puzzles another. Not all collectables can be collected until you complete the game so you are in for a long journey!\n\u26abIn any typical game you get side missions that are just downright boring and bland but in GOW:R they side quests REALLY standout as they add an unbelievable amount of character development behind them.\n\u26abThe graphics are superb. Gorgeous even and picture-perfect-post-card worthy at times. \n\u26abYou can freely explore several different realms, if you have played 2018's GOW then you will know of Alfheim, which has been changed a little but for the better which makes it stand out amongst all the other realms! \n\u26abThe attention to detail is phenomenal. This is what you call a WORK OF ART. A LABOR OF LOVE. You can tell the people that worked on GOW:R have true love and passion about the game!!!\n\u26abThe old armour customisation has now been streamlined and has been made very straightforward. Now you can take your favourite piece of equipment with you from start to end of the game!! \n\u26abThe puzzles are fun and new puzzles are introduced regularly which means you will not be doing the same thing over and over again for several hours till a new one comes into play.\n\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \nPhew... after all of that is said and done, I could go on and on and on in detail about each element of the game. Combat. Story. Graphics. Sound e.t.c but I cannot as Steam only allows a certain amount of words sadly but I think I have said enough for anyone looking to get into GOW:R!\n\nSo, would I recommend God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. DAMN RIGHT I WOULD!!! This is what you call a \"VIDEO-GAME\" that is true to both it's origins and it's future! It is made with love and passion, clearly, and will forever me the highest standpoint for future games of it's kind!\n\n[h1][b] 10/10 - GOTY worthy and undeniably unforgettable! A single-player game that blows away all others! [/b][/h1]",

Before you even see the main menu, the game directly ask you about a PSN account and you have literally only two options:\n1. Press A/Enter Agree to this stupid system and \"log in to your PSN account\" or\n2. Press B/Return to exit the Game.\nAre you serious?!\n\nYou pay 60\u20ac for a game which doesn't want to be played unless you log into some stupid system for a console which i never had, so only the managers can show investors some higher numbers so they can stuff more money into their pockets.\n\nOk, after this rant: The game it self is awesome! 10/10 to the developers, who created this masterpiece!\nSound Design: A+\nGameplay: A+\nWorld Design: A+\nArt Design: A+\nCamera: A+\nand everything else: also A+\nThis game is actually one of the best games in 2024 (for PC).\n\nIf i can make a request to the developer Teams \"Santa Monica Studio\" and \"Jetpack Interactive\":\nPlease show Sony a MIddlefinger and leave this sh*t company!\nSo many PC players want to play your games and sony is ripping you off by \"Sony exclusive\" Deals. if you would build the game and release it at the same time on all platforms the same time you would make more money and your reputaion would not go down together with sony!\nFrom my point i would love to buy a remastered/remake version of God of War 1-3 but not on sony sh*t consoles or system. give it to me on PC and i would be happy with each title for 60\u20ac!\n\nfor my last words i will only say this:\n[b][u]FUCK YOU SONY![/u][/b]",

        "review": "[h1]A Great Sequel, Held Back by Woke[/h1]\n\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\n\nI played God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k earlier this year on my PS5, spending over 90 hours to get the platinum for both the base game and the Valhalla DLC. You can check my stats and trophies here from the comments. After all those hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Ragnar\u00f6k delivers a great experience, though it has some issues that hold it back from being a masterpiece like its predecessor.\n\n[h3]Not Just a DLC[/h3] \n \nOne of the biggest criticisms people have thrown at Ragnar\u00f6k is that it feels like a glorified DLC of the 2018 game, but I strongly disagree with that take. Sure, it has a similar design and gameplay structure, but that doesn\u2019t make it a mere DLC. There\u2019s more than enough new content, including new realms, characters, and abilities, to call it a full-fledged sequel. The combat, which was already excellent in God of War 2018, feels more refined. Plus, the new variety of enemies and more boss fights elevate the action to another level.\n\n[h3]Expanded Gameplay and Content[/h3] \n\nThe gameplay in Ragnar\u00f6k is much more expanded compared to God of War 2018. There\u2019s more variety in combat options, and the game offers deeper customization for your weapons, armor, and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle in even more ways. Content-wise, the game also delivers far more to do, with a much richer world to explore. One major complaint about God of War 2018 was the repetitive enemy and boss fights. Thankfully, Ragnar\u00f6k improves on this significantly. While there are still some repeated enemies and bosses, it happens far less often than in the previous game. One of the standout improvements in Ragnar\u00f6k is the optional content. I've found them very fun to do and the same with hunting trophies once again, like the prequel. These side quests don\u2019t feel like chores; they\u2019re genuinely rewarding and worth doing. The post-launch Valhalla DLC is also a cool addition. While it\u2019s much shorter than I expected and I wish there was more of it to sink into, but I can\u2019t complain since it\u2019s free.\n\n[h3]The Woke Influence[/h3]\n\nThere\u2019s an undeniable feeling that Ragnar\u00f6k leans into a more woke tone. This isn\u2019t just a personal opinion. There\u2019s actual evidence that points to this. The developers worked with Sweet Baby Inc., a company known for inclusive storytelling, and that influence is noticeable throughout the game. Certain plotlines and character decisions feel forced, and at times, the story becomes nonsensical. While this may not bother some players, I found it detracted from the experience, making the narrative feel weaker. Replacing Cory Barlog as the main director was a huge mistake.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210225946\n\n[h3]Story and Narrative Issues[/h3] \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about one of the game\u2019s major drawbacks: the narrative. The 2018 game told a tight, focused narrative centered on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. In contrast, Ragnar\u00f6k introduces a lot more characters and plotlines, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t spend enough time fully developing these new elements, and as a result, the story feels rushed in certain parts. Instead of the tight, emotional focus of the first game, Ragnar\u00f6k tries to do too much and wraps up many plot points too quickly. Compared to the more compact, well-told story of God of War 2018, Ragnar\u00f6k struggles to find the same emotional depth and coherence. This is a huge bummer since I was really hoping for a great story and narrative after the bar set by the predecessor. \n\n[h3]Graphics \u2013 A Missed Opportunity[/h3]  \n\nVisually, Ragnar\u00f6k is a step up from God of War 2018, but not by much. The graphics are definitely a little better, with sharper textures and improved lighting effects. However, I can't help but feel that the game\u2019s visual potential was held back because it was also released for the PS4. If Ragnar\u00f6k had been a PS5 exclusive, I think the graphics could have been way better and more impressive. By having to cater to last-gen hardware, the game wasn\u2019t able to push the boundaries as far as it could have, which is a bit disappointing. Still, the game looked beautiful on the PS5 and I am sure it looks even better on PC.\n\n[h3]Music \u2013 Less Memorable[/h3]  \n\nSurprisingly, I didn\u2019t enjoy Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s soundtrack not even close to as I did the 2018 game's music. The composer, Bear McCreary, is the same for both, yet, the music in Ragnar\u00f6k didn\u2019t stick with me in the same way. That's because Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s soundtrack mainly consists of redone versions of tracks from its predecessor, with not many new compositions that stand out. This lack of fresh and impactful new music made the soundtrack feel less original and less memorable. I still occasionally listen to God of War 2018\u2019s soundtrack because it was so impactful, but I\u2019ve never felt the urge to listen to Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019s music outside the game.\n\n[h3]Expands, But Doesn\u2019t Elevate[/h3]\n  \nOverall, I feel like there\u2019s not much more to say about God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. The game\u2019s strengths are obvious, and they are mostly the same as in 2018. I\u2019ve also mentioned the negatives, such as the woke elements and narrative problems. On top of that, the fact that it plays so safe and similarly to God of War 2018, is a negative for me. When a sequel feels too close to its predecessor, it loses some of its impact for me. Don't get me wrong -Ragnar\u00f6k is a great game, and I highly recommend it- it just doesn\u2019t feel like the groundbreaking game that God of War 2018 was for me.\n\n[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\n\nFollow My [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/]Curator Page \u269c\ufe0f[/URL]",

I've locked it to 36 fps and 1 hour in the game feels pretty damn smooth.\n\nEdit: after playing further into the game when reaching svartalfheim there was a pretty big tank in performance on the steam deck. Upon entering svartalfheim I got roughly 25-30 fps some times dropping to 20 fps, however, after reaching the free roam area via boat the performance increased. I am actually able to play AMD FSR Quality between 30-45 fps I've now unlocked the refresh rate via steam deck settings and it is smoother than when I previously locked  it to 36fps. Also thank you for the clown awards, free points and I can play the game in peace knowing I didn't have to log into PSN network and cry about it.",

Everything else works but that. If I go into the menu you can see my mouse icon moving.. \nHave to keep changing camera settings and loading/reloading to eventually cause it to unfreeze.\nBut anytime I close the game and come back later, 9/10 this happens and takes a 6 or 7 reloads or fully restarts to get it working. Utter BS\n\n2) Crashes, no issues with crashing but now I'm on the quest with Brok & Freya.. I get to two wolves, I kill the first and while I'm fighting the second it freezes and crashes. Literally cannot get past this now. \n\n3) The horrible exp of the Sloooooooooooow Atreus talking sections on his solo quests. The one with the young girl in the swamp just draaags on so long. Its like it was done on purpose just to add more 'game time' to the overall game. They def could have done that better to progress his storyline without it being such a tedious snore fest. \n\nUpdating 22/9: \n4) Compiling Shader Cache\nLogged in today and its compiling at a horrendously slow speed. 10 mins have passed and its at 50%. Logged out of the game and its still loading on the main screen at the same slow pace.\n\nSorry but Sony can keep their ports if they are going to charge full price for 2 year old games and them not be so buggy on launch. \nSo as of right now I can't recommend this game with those issues alone and at this stage of play.",

Framegen was still broken (unable to select the setting without crashing).\n\nGame has weird animation issues. Kratos almost teleports left and right when you rapidly alternate between a and d keys, as though he's missing animation frames. Sometimes the camera randomly cuts to an entirely new angle in an instant. Many icons (e.g. mouse prompts) also look pixelated and enlarged and like they are out of a 2000s game - as though they didn't buy the high-resolution version of an icon pack. The menu UI could use a lot more polish; it's very awkward to navigate.\n\nWhen the game does work, it's a lot more of the first title - which is a good thing.\n\n---\n\nCan't recommend at this time. I would hold off until crash issues are resolved. I have sent no less than 8 crash reports in the last 10 minutes, and haven't even crossed the opening scene.\nMy specs are:\n5800x3d\nRTX 4090\n32 GB 3600mhz RAM\nMX500 SSD.\n\nI won't refund because i do want to play this game, and i feel that they will fix such egregious issues sooner rather than later.\n\nVery poor showing for launch, which is very unlike the recent ports such as Horizon and Tsushima.",
