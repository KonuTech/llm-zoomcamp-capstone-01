        "review": "Giving it a thumbs up but with heavy reservations.\r\n\r\nNeo Cab has us take a role of Lina, a cab driver in a neo-futuristic city. She's just moved in to the city to live with her best friend from the past whom she hasn't seen in ages. However, on the first night, her friend goes missing and Lina takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her friend and who is responsible while at the same time trying to make a living by driving passengers.\r\n\r\nSo in a sense, Neo Cab is a hybrid of a visual novel story and management gameplay which involves serving customers, making enough money to get by, and making sure your star rating stays high. Normally, this kind of genre mixing can be risky, but what the game has is connected well enough, without either aspect getting in the way of the other. The story is giving us an end goal to strive towards, whereas the management aspect is giving us something to do and think about while we're progressing through the plot. The gameplay isn't complicated really and all you need to keep track of are your money and your rating.\r\n\r\nWhile transporting customers, we get to learn a bit about them. They come in all kinds, the young and the old, the boring and the weird, the friendly and the hostile. Most (if not all) of them we get to meet multiple times throughout the game, so we get to know them really well and they could end up even helping us along during the main plot. In the way the customers are integrated into the game's story is pretty decent because we do learn something from each of them.\r\n\r\nSo the game loop is quite simple - you drive 3 customers per night, and occasionally visit some story-related location, then spend the night at a motel or one of those futuristic capsules, and then do the same the next night till six nights have passed. I personally was quite surprised how quickly and somewhat abruptly the game ended. I kind of expected it to go on for longer, with investigation taking more nights and requiring more tasks on our behalf, but it was pretty short and for many players might feel rather underwhelming. \r\n\r\nThe game's world is interesting and tackles interesting subjects relating to the near future, particularly automation of the workforce and the ways in which corporations could use and abuse new technology for their own personal benefit. But the main plot of searching for your friend and uncovering what on Earth she got involved in fell rather short in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhenever we interact with customers and any other characters, we often are given dialogue choices of what to say. This can impact how they feel about us and whether they would give us a good rating or share important information with us. One annoyance though that many other players seem to agree with is that the game often doesn't let you pick the dialogue choices you want to pick, possibly because the character is not in the right mood or something, so they outright refuse to say what you tell them to say. And speaking of their mood - it seems to jump all over the place at the drop of a hat, and this can be very hard to keep track of, especially that most times it really isn't clear how a particular dialogue branch will affect her mood. Most times you might as well just taking a wild guess at it (we can see how her mood gets changed due to a device she starts wearing on her wrist from early on in the game).\r\n\r\nGraphically the game is magnificent. In fact, the visuals are probably its biggest strength. The whole art style is very colourful, pleasing and in great style, fitting that neo-future aesthetic the game is going for. Coupled with decent background music in the style of synthwave, and the game is pretty enjoyable in its presentation. There is no voice acting here, which to some players may seem odd for a game like this, but to me personally it wasn't a big deal as I just treated it as a visual novel. \r\n\r\nI think the save system could be vastly improved though. It isn't clear when exactly the game gets saved, and the first time when I returned to the game, I realised the game didn't save a big chunk from my first sitting. In fact, I don't see a reason why the game couldn't just allow saving at any time. But even without it, it should be saving after every scene, including when you go to recharge the battery of your car, which for some reason the game doesn't save after. And when your progress is saved should be shown clearly.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt Neo Cab introduced an interesting world and some cool ideas, but as the game got to the late stages, it just fell flat and left me kind of disappointed. I can't say it's a bad game, but it left me with a rather plain and lukewarm taste at the end, especially with the \"I went through all that just for this\" ending that I got. So I'd say, if you're not a fan of this game genre or cyberpunk settings, then just safely ignore it, as you're not missing out. If you are a fan of these things, then best to get it on a discount.",

        "review": "A fantastic visual novel with some of the most relatable and witty dialogue I've seen in any game. A mix of political commentary on the advances of technology, how that affects our humanity and the struggle to maintain a connection with people in an ever-evolving social scene. The fact that you see the world from your car's seat through the eyes of your passengers, each with their own bias, wants and needs gives you a very nuanced and believable description of the world. In other words, worldbuilding at its finest, which fits perfectly with the cyberpunk theme! I can't help but fell some Taxi Driver vibes, but in a less violent, more wholesome way.\n\nAlmost each passenger/customer gets their mini story arc formed of 2-3 trips and on top of that you have the main plot which is helping your mysterious childhood best friend. The dialogue can feel annoying at times because of the emotion-based mechanics locking you out of choices, but I have to respect the devs for sticking to the \"staying in touch with humanity\" theme, even if they took some risks.\n\nLastly, I have to give props to the beautiful art, music and the very convenient save system who gives you a checkpoint after every ride, so you can go back and take the game in a different direction any time.\n\nI just think it is highly respectable how such a small team of devs, with very limited resources, managed to create a game that makes you feel like you're part of it not through hyper-real graphics or flashy mechanics, just through the power of dialogue and writing. Thank you Chance Agency for this experience and I'll hope you'll continue to make games with soul!",

We play Lina, a cab driver trying to make it day to day in a not-to-distant-future where surveillance, technology and capitalism have all but removed every last freedom for the individual.\r\nThe gameplay is relatively simple but with only a 4 hour runtime, it doesn't need to be anything more. However, the broader personal narrative for the protagonist and the limited options we have at expressing our own agency within the story left me frustrated. Maybe it was my decisions throughout the game that caused my Lina to become everyone's doormat, but the story resolved in a way where I never had the chance to stand up for myself, no matter how much I wanted to, and that left a bitter taste in my mouth.\r\nI would certainly recommend Neo Cab and I would be keen to hear about other's experiences with the game.",

        "review": "Cyberpunk Uber simulator but as a San Francisco visual novel set in cyber Los Ochos.  It's obviously written by Leigh Alexander and her narrative voice shines through.  The graphics are beautiful especially for something made in Unity.  The atmosphere and music is nice although it can be slow at times.  You're basically exploring the narratives of your customers which are delivered episodically.  The final emotional battle between Savvy and Lina owes a lot to the insult sword fights from Monkey Island.\n\nWorth playing if you've got it in your backlog and worth a buy if it's 85% off.  It'll last you a quick night or two.  It just kind of ends without anything visible occurring on camera.  Sometimes it feels weirdly prescient like the germophobe and giant worms before COVID and the Dune remakes.  Most of the passengers are jerks in a San Francisco techie/tedious revolutionary kind of way.  It's definitely written by an American, not a single passenger sits in the front passenger seat.\n\nPretty much everything Fellow Traveller publishes seems to be worth a look and is very highly polished.  Suzerain and The Pale Beyond are both better as games than Neo Cab, but it's no slouch and worth a look.",
