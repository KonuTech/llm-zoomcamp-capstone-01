        "review": "I came to Flintlock as a huge fan of the developer's previous game Ashen. This game is very different from that, despite both having soul-like elements in their design. \n\nWhere Ashen was an open-world game with a huge focus on exploration, and coop. Flintlock is closer to the modern God of War duologies with how it designs its semi-open world areas. It has no multiplayer, and is much lighter with its souls-like elements, properly calling itself a Souls lite. Its combat is closer to an outright action game, and I am all for it. Your movement is incredibly smooth and fluid, with one of the best-feeling triple jumps I have used in an action game. I find myself trying to use it when playing other third-person games it's so natural to use. \n\nIts mixing of guns and melee is very impactful, with both allowing for fast-paced defense with parries. I am very glad they did not try to use a stamina system, as between magic and guns being restored over time and from melee hits respectively, there is little downtime in combat. The gear and skill trees give you some personalization with your playstyle, but you are far more limited than a traditional souls like. You *will* use a mix of magic melee and guns if you want to succeed. \n\nThe story is not amazing, but still good and much more cinematic than the subtle storytelling of Ashen, with good performances from all the actors. Nor and her magic fox companion Enki, along with her crew of Sappers make up a good cast. With side quests for each of your camp members that will feel familiar to anyone who played Ashen. \n\nThe game is short, a normal run only being around 15 hours, with my extra time coming from playing about half the game on hard and replaying it to get all achievements, as well as spending a decent amount of time on the Sabo minigame. I have seen some hate for this mini-game online. But I miss when games used to throw in a mini-game just for fun. And it's easy to ignore other than its strangely brutal achievement. I would take it over a hacking mini-game that is forced into gameplay any day.\n\n\nOverall Flintlock is everything I want from an AA game. Its combat could easily hold up a much larger AAA game, even if its other elements show its lower budget and the small size of its developer.\n\nI think games like this, Stellar Blade, and Black Myth: Wukong show you can take elements of souls like combat, but use them along with more traditional action systems to great effect. \n\nI highly recommend Flintlock to action game fans, and souls like fans if you know what you are getting into.\n",

        "review": "[h1]Hell Yeah![/h1]\n\n[h2]Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a beautifully crafted action narrative game that feels so good to play![/h2]\n[i]And it's made in good ol' New Zealand ;) [/i]\n\n[h3]THE COMBAT:[/h3]\nThe combat is so smooth! The action is fast paced and varied with the impressive amount of enemy and weapon types that feels fluid and fun! The animations and visuals are stunning and the skills are actually quite impactful. Swinging at an enemy and then canceling their attack with a flintlock shot feels super satisfying to me! \n\n[h3]THE BOSSES:[/h3]\nThe bosses in Flintlock were, for the most part, pretty damn good! Their designs were unique and interesting, but I found that near the end the bosses felt a little too easy (I played on 'Normal'). There were a few repeat bosses but they weren't repeated enough to be a problem to me. Each boss felt fair and beatable which is always a good thing!\n\n[h3]THE STORY:[/h3]\nThe story of Flintlock is pretty good! while at times it can feel somewhat generic and predictable, I found myself not caring about that because Nor and Enki's relationship and banter kept me engaged. The voice acting would slightly vary in quality for the other characters, but Nor and Enki were awesome through the whole game! The other characters were interesting too and the side quests were very enjoyable! Side Quest Spoilers: [spoiler]I particularly enjoyed the [b][i]To The Forgotten[/i][/b] and [b][i]The Family Condition[/i][/b] side quests![/spoiler]\n\n[h3]THE WORLD:[/h3]\nThe open world aspects of Flintlock were perfect for me! The world felt big enough that I could explore and get some cool armour or weapons, but it wasn't too big that I felt lost (like a lot of games have had recently). The activities around the world were fun and rewarding and I enjoyed every minute of exploring it!\n\n[h3]THE OTHER STUFF:[/h3]\nThe performance was general pretty good (I averaged around 90 fps with max settings) but I did notice that in some areas the fps would drop significantly, but after a few seconds it would fix itself. I also noticed that the audio would sometimes be weirdly quiet in comparison the the rest of the audio but these will most likely get fixed in an update!\n\n[h3]CONCLUSION:[/h3]\nOverall, I found Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn to be an extremely enjoyable and highly polished indie action narrative game! The game felt similar to some AAA games like God of War (2018) but still managed to feel unique and stand on it's own legs! \n\n[h2]The team at A44 Games should be extremely proud of what they were able to achieve and I can't wait to see what's next![/h2]",

        "review": "I enjoyed my time with this game, overall flawed but really fun experience. The VA work really helped sell the characters despite them being fairly underwritten imo. The art design was beautiful, the sound design had some really weird issues of voices and actions sounding really far away even though they were close to the protagonist which was odd. The gameplay itself was fun, getting a parry off and blasting an enemy in the face with a shot was really satisfying. I enjoyed the reputation system. saving up the percentage and being rewarded with how well you played with more was a really cool feature. Having limited resources to upgrade weapons and armor was something that should have been communicated to the player more effectively. The ending and overall story once again did feel really underwritten, not quite complete. Maybe there will be a dlc to flesh out more of the world overall but who knows. A recommend from me.",

        "review": "Upvoted the game but it has issues. \n1 - phantom walls that block you from taking a short cut across the map are annoying. You MUST find a specific route to get to some places even though I found a way to get there faster.\n2 - What's the point of saying I can survive large falls if I do a double jump right before I hit the ground, if you're going to say I died when I jump off a ledge that the game deems \"too far\"? rhetorical..it's not fair to the gamer.\n3 - Why have areas mapped out on the map I can never go to? It's like they never finished the game or removed things to have it later as DLC. They might be in those areas. Islands and map areas near the outer edge seem to have things to do but I can't get to them. I searched and searched for doorways or access points and nothing. Sometimes it forces you to use the skull jump points or you can't get places.  \n4 - DO NOT go to the last (3rd) map travel area to go after Uru until you're sure you're ready. I passed/activated a ton of load stones and when I got to Uru's area, I tried to go back to the camp and it said i'ts disabled??? I have unfinished side quests I can never do.\nBTW once you fight Uru, the game just ends. You can't go back and finish side quests.\nThe graphics and gameplay overall are great though. I used an unlimited potions cheat and had fun with it because it also applies to grenades. You can then throw as many as you like. \nIt really does look good and plays fine but it has annoyances and things players need to know like, make sure you find everything in side quests before leaving an area to travel. This only applies to people who want to find all the hidden stuff and side quests. \nWhy are there like 20 slots for guns, grenades, etc etc and there appears to be very few of them. I found a whole 3 helmets. I assume all the other armor set items are in those hidden map areas. I tried to upgrade one axe but it said I didn't have one rare resource. I never saw that resource anywhere. \nIt was still fun to play.",

[/h1]\n\nFirst things first: While Flintlock definitely has some soulslike trappings, mainly in the way it handles death, it is really just a fairly competent riff on God of War 2019 -- if Kratos had a double jump and an air dash. \nYes, there's a parry and a dodge roll but there's no stamina bar you have to nurse and you can actually pause the game ;) \n\nWhile the combat doesn't feel especially good, the graphics aren't anything to write home about (except when they sometimes are) and the story is flimsy at best, this game just offers so many mechanics and they all tie together rather elegantly. Shooting, stabbing, throwing grenades, and magic are just a few ways you can dispatch enemies -- and the game actively encourages you to switch it up by upping your score multiplier, almost like it's Devil May Cry. \n\nSo yes, the game is good. Some great loot, beautiful music and chill vistas -- for less than 30 bucks I paid it's more than worth it.\n\nNow, I know, the question that's been burning on everyone's mind: is the game woke? \nJust kidding, I don't know. But you know what's certainly not woke? Touching grass.\n\n7/10",

        "review": "Based on my experience so far, this game is quite impressive. It effectively combines several elements from the God of War series with the challenge characteristic of Dark Souls. However, it is important to note that it is not a fully Souls-like game. Playing on the hard difficulty, as I do, often results in being defeated in just 2 - 3 hits.\n\nThe combat system is fluid and enjoyable, with a seamless integration of both melee and ranged combat, which adds to the overall excitement. Additionally, the game features platforming elements that provide a refreshing break after intense combat sequences, however, it feels a little rushed sometimes.\n\nAt this point, i can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Souls-like experiences or titles similar to God of War.\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44938427/]Check out my other reviews here[/url]",

        "review": "Flintlock is not a bad game.  I can understand people being wary of buying it seeing the SBI involvement and rightfully so as SBI has a track record of any game they are involved in being pretty awful, and I went in expecting to hear all about colonizers and the poor struggling main character who had it tough and happily got none of that (though more of her later).  I played on the hardest difficulty (possessed) and the beginning was quite challenging when I had no combat options and I would die in a few hits, but as the game went on it became more balanced.  \r\nGameplay would be most similar to 2018 God of War; you have your standard melee attacks, block, dodge and parry.  Enki your stand in Atreus has his stun attacks and his large rune attack.  You have the titular flintlock which is used much like the firearms in Bloodborne for interrupting attacks, and grenades of various types for extra flavor though difficult to get to in the middle of combat since it occupies the healing flask slot.  You have three armor slots (Head, Shoulder, Hand) and five different armor sets.  The armor provides no statistical benefit (no extra HP, no extra attack power), but changes the way the characters plays (extra distance on melee attacks, slow down time if you dodge last second, etc.).  The leveling system is three interlinked trees (Firearms, Melee, Magic) and each node gives a new skill or enhancement to existing skills with each node in a tree giving a small boost to the damage from that tree to a maximum of 140%.\r\nThe game takes a while for the combat to really show itself and I would say I started to appreciate it around when I got my first piece of armor which I believe was a few hours into the game.  From then on things felt balanced where I could clear towns without dying, but if I was lazy I could be killed easily (this may vary depending on the difficulty you play on).\r\nThe characters are mostly enjoyable though the main character seems to start off as annoying and headstrong but fairly quickly matures.  Enki was great though having him constantly tell me I am a natural after 20 hours (days/weeks? in game time) of going through the slip gates got old.  The rest of the sapper crew were a mixed bunch, but by the end I enjoyed them for what they were, old man father figure, stoic guy, other guy, and bitchy chick that respects you.\r\nThe story was enjoyable but I swear this game was meant to be another 25% longer or so as some plot points (betrayals) are immediately glossed over in cut-scenes; e.g. character A betrays character B's trust, in the immediate cut-scene another character says they've been talking among themselves and when you get back to gameplay it's all good.  It's very jarring having these moments that feel important suddenly get shuffled off with no time to digest.  The world is interesting, the enemies are fine (some better than others and the later ones better than the early ones), the music was enjoyable.\r\nThere are bugs and I have doubts they will be fixed, they don't stop you from completing the game but they are real annoying.  One bug is that a horde (large group of normal enemies you can clear for extra exp/money) could not be completed as the final enemy would not count toward the total group health and so when all of the enemies were killed the encounter never ended.  The second bug I ran into was that on the enemy turn in the Sebo mini-game if you open and close the special piece menu while hovering over a special piece you will constantly remove turns from the enemy even giving the enemy negative turns meaning as soon as they make their first move they lose the game (I hated Sebo so once I realized this was still a thing I abused it).  The third bug I encountered was that after winning a game of Sebo the game stopped asking if I wanted to keep playing Sebo and just assumed I did, I could not escape the mini-game even if I forfeit the match and so had to alt f4 out of the game (though winning the match had been saved).  I had one crash on the final boss during a cutscene in between phases which made me start the whole fight over, but did not set my health or resources to pre-fight conditions, but that was my one game crash.  I had quite a few bad stutters while playing which did sometimes lead to me dying (less than ten more than five).\r\nOverall Flintlock isn't going to revolutionize anything, but if you are looking for a not quite open world (again like GoW 2018) with a decent combat system and ok world, some decent characters, for a decent price then you could do worse than this.",

        "review": "Not every game needs to be a masterpiece in order to be an amazing fun time. If you're looking for a entertaining action game, with some challenge and \"Souls\" elements, give this game a chance!\n\nI rarely write review on games, but with this one I felt compelled to do it. There's a whole discourse surrounding this game that obnubilates what's really important in video games: HAVING FUN.\n\nFirst of all, let's adress the elephant in the room, the \"SBI thing\": There's no politics in this game, there's no forced inclusion. There's nothing to hate about the game being woke or bigot. Nothing. This is a \"popcorn videogame\" in the best possible way. It takes itself serious enough just to avoid those Josh-Whedon-like jokes.\n\nThe combat is a mix between Bloodborne/Lies of P and God of War, clearly less polished than these, but with a way better designed companion mechanics than the latter. You parry with block or gun, depending on your enemies attacks and resource management, and you're encouraged to sinchronize your attacks with Enki (the fox companion) for boosts and benefits. There's also some lite character building that emerges from armor/weapon/skills synergy.\n\nIf you want to have the \"Souls\" experience, the hard mode is very well balanced to what veterans are used to. You can not brute force through the enemies, you will need to be strategic about combat. There is some jank here and there, particularly in the plataforming, but the movement in combat is very well polished. Progression is also well acomplished, you might have to \"farm\" to unlock all skills, but the gameplay changing ones are very low in the tree.\n\nOverall the game si solid fun, IMO well worth the AA price asked for it.",

Fun risk/reward mechanics, feels like a hybrid of God of War and Souls-like (but not punishing), with more mobility, crafting isn't over-complicated (there are like 3 resource types), and you build up the skill tree at a consistent pace through the game.\nWould buy again",
