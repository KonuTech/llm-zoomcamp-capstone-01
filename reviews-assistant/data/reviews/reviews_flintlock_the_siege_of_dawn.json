        "review": "Upvoted the game but it has issues. \n1 - phantom walls that block you from taking a short cut across the map are annoying. You MUST find a specific route to get to some places even though I found a way to get there faster.\n2 - What's the point of saying I can survive large falls if I do a double jump right before I hit the ground, if you're going to say I died when I jump off a ledge that the game deems \"too far\"? rhetorical..it's not fair to the gamer.\n3 - Why have areas mapped out on the map I can never go to? It's like they never finished the game or removed things to have it later as DLC. They might be in those areas. Islands and map areas near the outer edge seem to have things to do but I can't get to them. I searched and searched for doorways or access points and nothing. Sometimes it forces you to use the skull jump points or you can't get places.  \n4 - DO NOT go to the last (3rd) map travel area to go after Uru until you're sure you're ready. I passed/activated a ton of load stones and when I got to Uru's area, I tried to go back to the camp and it said i'ts disabled??? I have unfinished side quests I can never do.\nBTW once you fight Uru, the game just ends. You can't go back and finish side quests.\nThe graphics and gameplay overall are great though. I used an unlimited potions cheat and had fun with it because it also applies to grenades. You can then throw as many as you like. \nIt really does look good and plays fine but it has annoyances and things players need to know like, make sure you find everything in side quests before leaving an area to travel. This only applies to people who want to find all the hidden stuff and side quests. \nWhy are there like 20 slots for guns, grenades, etc etc and there appears to be very few of them. I found a whole 3 helmets. I assume all the other armor set items are in those hidden map areas. I tried to upgrade one axe but it said I didn't have one rare resource. I never saw that resource anywhere. \nIt was still fun to play.",

I absolutely love platforming and movement system. Exploration feels rewarding. Good environmental storytelling skeletons.\n\nI feel a lot of sympathy for both Nor and Enki, who is such a good companion - with his abilities, personality, and amazing animations. Also voice acting is truly fantastic for both of them.\n\nSo my only complain would be that game was sometimes dropping frames in the second part of the game, *BUT* 1) my processor is worse than suggested one in minimum requirement 2) it worked on Ubuntu, so that's on me.\nAlso I wish it would has more options in photomode, cause capturing Nor and Venki was also very fun.",

[/h1]\n\nFirst things first: While Flintlock definitely has some soulslike trappings, mainly in the way it handles death, it is really just a fairly competent riff on God of War 2019 -- if Kratos had a double jump and an air dash. \nYes, there's a parry and a dodge roll but there's no stamina bar you have to nurse and you can actually pause the game ;) \n\nWhile the combat doesn't feel especially good, the graphics aren't anything to write home about (except when they sometimes are) and the story is flimsy at best, this game just offers so many mechanics and they all tie together rather elegantly. Shooting, stabbing, throwing grenades, and magic are just a few ways you can dispatch enemies -- and the game actively encourages you to switch it up by upping your score multiplier, almost like it's Devil May Cry. \n\nSo yes, the game is good. Some great loot, beautiful music and chill vistas -- for less than 30 bucks I paid it's more than worth it.\n\nNow, I know, the question that's been burning on everyone's mind: is the game woke? \nJust kidding, I don't know. But you know what's certainly not woke? Touching grass.\n\n7/10",

        "review": "Based on my experience so far, this game is quite impressive. It effectively combines several elements from the God of War series with the challenge characteristic of Dark Souls. However, it is important to note that it is not a fully Souls-like game. Playing on the hard difficulty, as I do, often results in being defeated in just 2 - 3 hits.\n\nThe combat system is fluid and enjoyable, with a seamless integration of both melee and ranged combat, which adds to the overall excitement. Additionally, the game features platforming elements that provide a refreshing break after intense combat sequences, however, it feels a little rushed sometimes.\n\nAt this point, i can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Souls-like experiences or titles similar to God of War.\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44938427/]Check out my other reviews here[/url]",
