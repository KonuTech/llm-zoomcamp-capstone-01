        "review": "I usually shun major AAA games in favor of small indie publishers. So when this game first came out and got a lot of attention, I ignored it, thinking it was overrated. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to give Baldur's Gate 3 a try. Boy, have I been missing out.\r\n\r\nGame play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons. There are nice tie-ins to the series that D&D players (including myself) will appreciate, such as certain races like elves and half-elves having dark vision, critical successes and critical failures, and classes like bards, wizards, and fighters. One key difference between the game and D&D is that in Baldur's Gate 3, instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn, initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat. Knowledge of D&D isn't required to play though, as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive.\r\n\r\nWhere the game really shines is all of its content. There are so many classes, paladin, barbarian, fighter, druid, cleric, bard, and monk, and just as many races too. Many classes and races also have sub-classes or sub-races, which allows in-depth customization of your characters. The only problem with this is customizing your first character (assuming you don't choose a pre-made one) can take a very long time, especially if you're indecisive like me. My first character Daelis, was a Wild Magic Sorcerer, and I had a cleric, fighter, and rogue in my party. Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe story was very enjoyable (no spoilers here!). You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with far-reaching consequences throughout, this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential. I liked how my party members' backstories diverged and intersected with the main story. Each character was well-written and fully-fleshed out, which made it feel like a real D&D campaign. There isn't much replayability when it comes to the main story. You can make different decisions, which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same. Unlike D&D there is only one campaign. Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second. Replayability is instead found in game play and quests. It's impossible to complete every quest, especially every party member's unique quests, in one play through. All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value. You can also recruit different party members than last time, resulting in new character interactions.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is saving in the game. There is an auto-save system, but it only activates after you enter important areas. You're forced to manually quick-save most of the time. I eventually got the hang of it, but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quick-save and lost progress. I played on the Balanced difficulty, which is essentially normal, and struggled during many fights. I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing. That's more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though. If you play a lot of casual games and don't have experience with RPGs, I'd recommend the Narrative or easy mode. Things will still be challenging, it's just your blood pressure won't spike as much.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good game for anyone who likes D&D or story-rich RPGs with lots of content.",

As someone who has never played turn-based or anything D&D-related, here is my review:\n\nI saw this game a year ago and was hesitant to try it due to the turn-based combat and having absolutely no prior experience with D&D. I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play, and oh boy was I wrong. This is truly a masterpiece; the level of depth in this game is insane. It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and D&D as a whole.\n\nAt first, the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me, resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone. But I'm glad it's there because it just makes it that much more replayable. This level of choice continues throughout the game, ensuring your experience is what you want it to be.\n\nMost of these longer story games end up tiring me out, so I just rush through to the end to not feel like I've wasted the time I spent on it already. BG3 is an exception to that; despite being the longest game out of all of them, I truly enjoyed the whole journey.\n\nBefore I even finished the game, I already couldn't wait to do another playthrough with mods and different choices. Now that I have finished the game, I can confidently say that the feeling hasn't changed, and I'll be doing another playthrough in the future, probably an evil one...",

But, Larian doesn't do that. They say it's a game for adults and they mean it, and they respect us adult players by not baiting and switching on the adult content. They warn everyone that the game contains adult content, and it's not just some marketing ploy to draw people in and try to get them to buy it. There is actual adult content, and bunches of it too.\n\nThere are plenty of family safe games out there, and far too many \"adult content\" games that then sanitize the actual adult content, so an adult content game that actually treats us adults like adults, and not like children that need to be protected by them deciding what we should or should not see, is something I think Larian should get more praise for on top of all the other well deserved praise and numerous awards. So, Thanks Larian, for treating us adults as adults, as well as making the most awesome CRPG of all time.",

After investing over 370 hours, I can confidently say that it\u2019s been one of the most rewarding experiences I\u2019ve ever had in my +16 years of gaming!\n\nAs someone who\u2019s relatively new to games like Baldur's Gate 3, The game has done wonders in introducing me to the complexities of D&D within a digital realm. The adaptation of traditional tabletop mechanics into a seamless and engaging gameplay experience is nothing short of remarkableness.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the world of Faer\u00fbn feels alive and immersive, thanks to the stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The narrative is very engaging and full of twists, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful. The voice acting and character interactions are absolutely top-notch! Bringing the story and its inhabitants to life in a way that\u2019s truly memorable.\n\nWhat really sets Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 apart is its depth. With hundreds of quests, countless choices, and a variety of playstyles, there\u2019s always something new to discover. The replayability is off the charts! Each playthrough can be a completely different experience! The flexibility in character creation and party dynamics allows you to craft a unique adventure every time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of RPGs in general or just looking for a game that offers a rich, engaging experience, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is more than worth your time. My 370+ hours are a testament to its insane quality and replayability. This game has completely set a new standard for the genre! And I highly recommend it to anyone!\n\nThat said, if there is one \"downside\" that I could possible think of that is worth mentioning about Baldur's Gate 3, It has to be the fact that it may not be the most welcoming for players who are completely new to the D&D aspect of the game [u] (Like me!) [/u] . The depth and complexity of the D&D mechanics can be daunting quite a bit at first, and it takes some time to fully grasp the nuances if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the system. However, this challenge is also a blessing in disguise. It pushes you to learn and appreciate the intricacies of D&D, enriching your overall experience and deepening your understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics. If you\u2019re like me and are very excited to dive into the beauty of RPG with a truly remarkable blend with D&D, The feeling of immersion is something to totally embrace! \n\n[h3] ALSO! [/h3]\n\nI\u2019m incredibly excited to see what Patch 7 has in store and how it will further enhance this already amazing game! A huge shoutout to Larian Studios and everyone who worked on this project. Your dedication and passion have created an absolute masterpiece and This game is a testament to your incredible talent and hard work, and I\u2019m grateful for the unforgettable adventure you\u2019ve given us all! \n\n[b] From the bottom of my heart.

By the end of the game some of my party members were so powerful, it felt amazing!\n\nAs for role playing, it does a lot: tons of choices with consequences (some of them really dark, so be careful!), class and race specific dialog options, very interesting companions, lots of other memorable NPCs, and the D&D lore and background it's built upon.

You have to deal with a rest system that is difficult to integrate in a natural game flow, the hit/miss mechanics that can make you play entire turns with no result, and a progression system that makes you choose between straight up improving your character or getting access to minor fun options. None of those make the game bad, but it makes you wonder how good the game would have been if it wasn't tainted by D&D.\n\ud83d\udcad Narratively it also suffers from being set in Forgotten Realms due to how much the worldbuilding relies on there being \"evil\" races to justify having default antagonists the player won't feel bad about killing. The game tries to timidly tackle the subject a few times, but all the goblins you see are still evil raiders, and it is never questioned.\n\n\u274c There is one major dissonance between what the narration conveys and what is expected from the player - the game sets up a huge feeling of urgency right from the start, pushing the player to hurry up and take as few breaks as possible, while a lot of the game's events actually need long rests to occur, and there are no downsides to resting (apart from possibly running out of resources, but that isn't really a factor either, you find a lot of food). Just know that there is no hurry, and you need to rest quite often to not miss interesting narrative content.\n\nOverall, Baldur's Gate 3 manages the feat of being a wonderful game despite being based on a mediocre game system and being set in a mediocre fantasy setting - you actually feel the amount of effort it took to swim against the current here and produce something so good in the end. It makes me even more optimistic about the next game by Larian Studios - if I could get any more optimistic after Divinity Original Sin 2.",

Even for those who are unfamiliar with DND this is a very enjoyable game. You can play at your own pace, think out all your actions, save and go back if you need to. The story is very fun and there's some cool conflicting choices to make. Probably never bought a game worth more it's price than this. The first run through will take about 100 hours and then you'll wanna do it again to change the story. xoxo 10/10 game.",

        "review": "Baldurs Gate 3 is by far one of the best games I've ever played in my life so far...I could stop there but I'll elaborate. This game just warms and hugs my D&D nerd heart...for this a game made for fans of D&D and every fantasy lover out there. The game lore is rich with so much details and bit and bobs to discover, the story is epic and will stay with me for the rest of life. Some of the best turn-based combat I've ever seen in a video game you have so many options of what you can do and you don't have to simply attack you can throw shit, jump, shove, light your sword on fire, throw a barrel of explosives, heal your ally by throwing a potion at them (it just works lol) and etc. It's so intricate and so well crafted...and lastly there's one other thing I wanna talk about...the companions...I will start with the order I met them don't worry I will be using spoiler texts. I really worry I may repeat shit for various characters lol\n\nLae'zel is an absolute unit, besides that she comes across as rude and not exactly friendly it's more like she comes from place where everyone had the attitude or that outlook and by all things that may point to the contrary...Lae'zel is the nicest githyanki alive..she's got a heart of gold under that armour, she's brave as all hell and she can be quite socially awkward and I love her...and she also happens to my favourite..whether she be dispatching foes as a fighter or the times I've changed her into a Paladin...god does she wreck people as a Paladin...\n\nShadowheart was the character I romanced with my first character and by god am I glad I did, Shadowheart is such a sweet person and she's very witty and the absolute best...like my god her story is so well done and I love watching her transform as a person throughout and various moments of quiet spent along her are moments well spent..and my god does she mess people up with that spirit guardians...favourite thing to do just sprint past enemies with spirit guardians up and just watch em all die...or wait for them to come to you lol\n\nAstarion is my favourite vampire spawn arsehole...not a spoiler literally everyone who plays the game can tell he is one..he's funny as all hell and very sarcastic and I just love this jackass and watching his story and my gawd his story was so fucking good like I can see why so many people on ArchiveofourOwn are obsessed with this man! (still don't get the love for Gortash thou...that man be evil) And my god is it good to always have a rogue at the handy!\n\nGale is charming as fuck...like my god the man could wax poetic shit and talk about magic and I'd listen to every word...god I really gotta romance the fuck out of this Bearded Wizardly Sage! Not much else to say besides I love him and I wanna romance him...\n\nWyll is the fucking best. Everyone whose ever said he's boring can go fuck off to Avernus! He's a folk hero to the truest he's got charm, he's got the sense of humour, he's got a sense of duty, he's got shady deal with an otherworldly patron (warlocks am I right?) and I just love this man...like I can't see why people dislike him. Wyll, Shadowheart and Lae'zel usually were my go to team throughout the game (mainly my first playthrough I'm mixing things up with my other playthroughs) like he is such a fun character and so useful my god...warlocks man Elderitch blast go brrrrr\n\nKarlach is an absolute cinnamon roll and like oh my gawd I'd take the second degree burns to give her a hug. I remember hearing somewhere she gives off autistic vibes and as someone with autism since I was 4 I was like...OOOOHHH that's why I get her so well LOL! But yeah she's the fucking best and having her by my side and just tanking so many hits and also dealing so much fucking damage was an absolute treat! \n\nNow we get into spoiler territory companions who I'll spoiler text here and there for!\n\nAct 2 Companion Spoilers\n[spoiler]Halsin is a giant man of muscle and meat and he's awesome, he's useful in battle no matter what and I love how caring he was for various things from nature to whittling wooden ducks. Also got to romance him alongside Shadowheart my first playthrough! Hurrah for Polyamory! Also god dam did having a man who can turn into an owl bear on your side at any moment help! [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Minthara could step on me and I wouldn't complain lol! Her voice my god...also awesome character. She's serious as but also very stoically funny and she has so many good lines from the one about the Drider wedding to various other hits. She's so handy and it's very elaborate way to recruit her in a good play-through by the knocking her out in act 1 while in battle and freeing her act 2 in moonrise but apparently I haven't gotten to see it myself it's easier now after patch 7...can't wait to look more into that but yeah she's awesome Paladin in BG3 is...very OP and it's always good to have her on hand...admittedly I did kill her first playthrough (didn't know at the time) but every other playthrough I did knock her out...[/spoiler]\n\nAct 3 Companion spoilers! Again don't read this if you don't want to be spoiled\n[spoiler]Jaehira is blast to have on your side, having a wise and cranky old hero but still wisecracking is such a treat and I would never say no to two druids on the team.

        "review": "bg3's worst trait is that battling is simply unbearable. each combat encounter can last you anywhere from 5-50 minutes, with no way to speed up enemy turns or to organise quickened assaults on enemies. great games have floundered with similar mechanics - kotor, for example, but what separates kotor from bg3 is that it has SOME GAMEPLAY LOOP OUTSIDE OF BATTLE. every quest leads to some reason for battle - usually you have to find something, kill it, and then take its useless and low value sword. every puzzle (...is toddler-like in terms of complexity and) facilitates more combat encounters. every failed skill check and even many passed ones all lead to the same thing. another egregiously slow and drawn out combat sequence. the only motivation to play outside of combat is the story (there is rarely any motive to explore - all you'll find are randomly generated chests and COMBAT ENCOUNTERS) and even that feels specifically written for those who havent read a book since english lit class but who play because they heard there was blue hair and polyamorous sex scenes. it SUCKS! every beat is the most generic thing you could possibly think of - every companion has a sad backstory that requires them to sacrifice their life, every order bigger than the individual is concerned with the things bigger than themselves, every small rebellion is full of cowering wimps that require you to find their hobbled little victorian child brother named sickly timothy or something. nothing means anything deeper than 'Le power is Le tempting but don't get corrupted!' and 'death is bad unless good guys think that then it's bad' and worst of all 'endlessly rerolling skill checks via quick saving and quick loading is worth the hours of your life youll waste doing it'",

        "review": "[h1] This is what an RPG should be [/h1]\r\n\r\nBG3 is what I consider a real RPG. For me, the cornerstone feature of an RPG is that choices really matter, unlike many so-called \"RPGs\". In my experience, games are often labeled as RPGs simply because they incorporate RPG aspects like combat styles, skill progression, or custom character appearance. This is not the case here. [b]Every decision you make has consequences[/b], making the world feel dynamic and immersive as you progress. I am not a fantasy-style enjoyer, but the fact that your actions change the world around you counters that.  \r\n  \r\nThere are [b]no fetch quests[/b] in this game, as far as I remember. Each quest has meaning and impact on the story. There is also no meaningless filler dialogue. Even the one-liners of non-essential NPCs are done well.  \r\n  \r\nI generally don't like turn-based gameplay, but this type of gameplay made the game very balanced (at least on tactical difficulty). Enemies really feel like a threat, and you can't just oneshot anyone you don't like. After finishing the game, I watched videos on youtube and saw instakill exploits, but while playing blindly, I did not find them.  \r\n  \r\nThe UI could use some improvements. For example, a search bar for the camp chest or indicators for empty containers would be helpful, as there are many empty or near-empty chests.  \r\n  \r\nThere were some bugs, however. Some quest scripts get broken when taking an unusual approach or exploring too much.  \r\n  \r\n[b]8.5/10[/b]\r\n\r\n",

        "review": "[h2]A Delicate Dance Between Story and Sandbox[/h2]\n\nI just finished the first half of Act 1, and what impresses me most about [i]Baldur\u2019s Gate III[/i] is its masterful balance between a structured narrative adventure and a sandbox full of creative possibilities.\n\nOn one hand, the game presents itself as a polished AAA experience: fully-voiced cinematic cutscenes at nearly every turn, an overwhelming amount of items to collect and interact with, and despite the ever-present danger in the world, there\u2019s no real passage of in-game time, meaning no sense of urgency is forced upon you. You can explore at your own pace.\n\nOn the other hand, the game features a sophisticated simulation of physics that allows for emergent gameplay. Characters and items can catch fire, freeze, get soaked in water or acid, and more. Fire spreads, water douses it, conducts lightning, and can even be frozen. Nearly every object in the world can be moved or manipulated, and there\u2019s an impressive range of player abilities that encourage experimentation. These systems lead to creative solutions for combat, exploration, and beyond, allowing for moments that feel entirely unscripted.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is how these two elements\u2014the tightly scripted, cinematic storytelling and the open-ended, sandbox mechanics\u2014seem almost at odds, yet they work in perfect harmony. The story keeps you focused and immersed, while the sandbox lets you play your own way, appealing to both story-driven and systems-driven players. The best part? Each system stands strong on its own. Even if you only engage with a fraction of the game\u2019s mechanics, [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] still feels complete and satisfying. It never overwhelms you with what you \u201cshould\u201d be doing; instead, it lets you play at your own pace, focusing on the things you enjoy most.\n\nFor example, I spent much of the first act focused on exploration and combat, only to realize later that I could\u2019ve been speaking to my animal companions or raising the dead for extra insight! Meanwhile, other players may speed through the story, missing out on the rich environmental puzzles and clever combat tactics. But that\u2019s the beauty of it\u2014everyone can enjoy [i]Baldur\u2019s Gate III[/i] in their own unique way.\n\nThis careful balance between focused narrative and emergent gameplay reminds me of the best parts of [i]Deus Ex[/i], and that\u2019s no small praise. [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] is a true achievement.\n\n[h2]Beyond the Honeymoon: How [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] Evolves Alongside You[/h2]\n\nAs I finished Act 1, what struck me even more than the initial thrill of [i]Baldur\u2019s Gate III[/i] and the delicate balance between the scripted and emergent elements was how the game evolves as you move beyond the honeymoon period.\n\nThe introduction gently eases the more story-driven players in with cinematic cutscenes and a strong narrative focus, which makes sense since you need to meet all the characters in your party and understand their motivations. But by midgame, it becomes something different\u2014more open, more mechanically focused, and perhaps even more enjoyable because of it. It\u2019s like a relationship where the early excitement gives way to a deeper, more grounded understanding. What begins as a polished, cinematic adventure turns into a game that embraces its complexity, flaws and all.\n\nTake the turn-based combat, for instance. Unlike the real-time systems of earlier games in the series, the slower pace of [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] could easily frustrate some players. However, the early encounters are kept small and simple, easing players into the tactical depth gradually. This approach helps story-focused players adapt, as they may not have expected the slower rhythm of turn-based combat. By midgame, though, this slower pace feels natural\u2014something you\u2019ve grown to understand and appreciate.\n\nSimilarly, the absence of a day-night cycle might seem like a limitation, but it\u2019s cleverly hidden by the fixed camera angles, which prevent players from seeing the sky. (This also likely improves performance by reducing the need for rendering distant objects and environments.) By the time you notice this design choice, it feels like a natural part of the world, something you\u2019ve accepted as part of the journey.\n\nThis shift is also reflected in character progression. In Act 1, you level up quickly, racing toward level 10 by the end, just shy of the level cap of 12. But in the midgame, the pace slows dramatically, shifting the focus from leveling to acquiring and managing powerful items, and keeping the party buffed through spells and elixirs that you have, by this point, learned to craft. The game becomes more about optimization, strategy, and exploration rather than just hitting the next level. And by this point, the change feels right\u2014you\u2019ve grown with the game, and it no longer needs to rely on instant gratification to keep you engaged.\n\nIn the end, [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] reveals itself to be more than just the game you started. What begins as a story-driven RPG transforms into a more open-ended, systems-heavy experience, and by the time you realize it, you\u2019ve come to appreciate both its strengths and its flaws. Like any good relationship, it\u2019s the imperfections that make it unique, and it's the journey that helps you see them in a new light.",

Phenomenal writing, story, characters, world building, voice acting, and amount of detail crammed into this adventure is incredible. The sheer number of ways you can approach situations in and out of combat still blows my mind; I would absolutely love to see how Larian designed and programmed this game to accommodate for all of the different interactions and decisions you make along the 200+ hours it took me to complete the game and 99% of the quests. \n\nWhile I'm not the biggest turn-based combat fan (or know the rules of D&D), the strategy of it encourages you to try and think outside of the box at times. This becomes rewarding when you successfully complete a longer combat encounter using a mixture of magic/items to manipulate the game environment to your advantage when zerg-rushing and left-click attacking might not be viable. The amount of replayability is insanely high; I dare you to try a fully evil playthrough after a \"good\" playthrough and see if you can stomach some of the decisions you'll need to make! It's going to be tough to try and top a RPG like this, but I can't wait to see what Larian is working on next.",

As it turns out, I'm not really a fan of turn-based combat. Even Pathfinder was not my cup of tea. So I stayed away from this game for a long time after it came out. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, when some vampire twink kept showing up in my TikTok feed. The character writing was good . . . The art style looked amazing . . . \n\nFine. I'll play the stupid game. But I didn't expect to enjoy it. \n\nFast forward again to me having over 200 hours in 6 months. Holy shit . . . I don't think there's a single companion character that I don't care about. They all have compelling personalities. The story is fun and engaging. It's like your own little D&D game. You can play by yourself or with friends. If you're not creative, you can even play as one of the companion characters. There's a bunch of different endings, so it really feels like your choices impact the story. And even now, over a year after the release, Larian is still adding more content. I'm so glad I gave this game a chance, because it is now one of my favorite games ever. And I know that I will have plenty to still discover when I do another play-through.

Great to play solo and great to play with friends.\r\n\r\nGraphics here are beautiful, story is compelling, characters are well written and combat is satisfying, but also challenging.\r\n\r\nThe only think that I can complain about is camera, which in times can be troublesome, especially when you are trying to cast or attack a enemy that's higher then yours, but to be honest it's not the end of the world there are ways to get around it.\r\n\r\nTIP: If you want to play with a friend, but doesn't want to buy the game twice because it's too expensive for your budget you can always buy it once and play it on a split screen using Steam Remote Play (or just play it on normal split screen).",

        "review": "Much like Dark Souls, this game had such a profound impact on me that it changed my life. Not in a good way - now I just compare every game to Baldur's Gate 3 and get depressed when they can't hold a candle to it. I'm sure for years we will all be chasing the high that was our first play though of this game - having to cope with the crippling feeling of knowing everything else pales in comparison. \n\nThis game is absolutely massive. MASSIVE. Not just map size - the possibilities are massive as well. I have 100 hours in this game and I didn't do everything there is to do. (yes my playtime says 150 hours but my 2 year old son would not stop turning the game on, I guess he loves it too.) Even if I had done everything I could do in a single playthrough - that still leaves out an enormous amount of different decisions I could have made throughout the game. So many choices, skill checks, missed areas - all yet to be experienced by the time you see the credits roll for the first time. Not only that, but there are dozens upon dozens of builds you can do in this game. There is a nigh infinite amount of replayability for the character builds alone.\n\nThe absolute best part of this game however is the intimate character interactions. Motion captured and fully voiced, dialogues take an over-the-shoulder perspective instead of opting to stay at an isometric view. This enhances the experience immensely. Couple this with the plethora of things to do in the game - *[i]chefs kiss[/i]* - just incredible.\n\nMy only regret is now that I've played it, I can never play it for the first time EVER AGAIN. I call this this \"Attack on Titan dilemma.\"\n\n",

        "review": "This is the best CRPG I have ever played, beating out even all the Bioware/Interplay classics. This game is so good it ruins other CRPGs because it makes them look boring and simple.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n+ Dialogues aren't boring text boxes with a voice over you can out-read. Instead they are over the shoulder or sometimes a little more cinematic. This brings you into the conversation much better than a text box. I actually turned off the subtitles so I don't get distracted and can stay immersed.\n+ This game has the greatest amount of choice and consequence I have ever seen in any game. Virtually every quest can be completed in multiple ways. You are constantly given multiple dialogue options that usually have some kind of impact on the conversation beyond slightly changed dialogue. Say the wrong things and you can start a fight, end it amicably, or perhaps some other consequence. Karlach is so physically hot she can't be touched. What about a fire resistance potion? Surely the game wouldn't react to that... try it :). The encounter in act 1 to enter the tombs where you find a certain NPC can be approached in four, yes four, ways, each granting you unique dialogue depending on the direction you approach. Can you figure out the fourth way? And many, many more things.\n+ Reactivity to your race, class, and Origin character. You sometimes get unique dialogue options and NPC responses depending on those. True though it rarely changes much (unless you're Dark Urge) but it's still fun and huge for roleplaying.\n+ Environment interaction and reactivity is unprecedented. So many ways to play with the environment including for solving quests or manipulating battles. When no one is looking quickly pick up a locked chest so you can open it somewhere safe. Use Mage Hand to scout and manipulate objects safely. And much more.\n+ I didn't care for Origin characters in DOS2, but here they feel much more fun, not just to play as but also as companions to talk to and adventure with. All of them are memorable to me.\n+ Immensely replayable, not just thanks to the above but also with all the classes and the multiple ways to play them.\n+ No predatory practices like microtransactions or content cut then sold as DLC. What you see is what you get, and what you get is one of the best deals in gaming.\n+ Despite what some people try to claim the game is NOT full of wokeness. Yes the companions are player-sexual meaning they are attracted to you no matter who you are, so this means the power of who to romance is in your hands. Also unlike what some people say it's very easy to tell when a companion is hitting on you, so just say no if you don't like it. Furthermore if there's any characters that offend you, virtually everyone in the game is killable (even your companions). Have fun!\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n+- While the game overall is the best CRPG, the writing falls a tad short compared to the classics of old. This is due to the fact that every character line plus the narrator is voiced, so we don't get the long, eloquent descriptions and detailed conversations we got in the past. But the writing here is still good, certainly better than pretty much any AAA game nowadays. And having everything voiced with the cinematic camera makes the conversations far more immersive than a mere text box no matter how well written it is.\n+- The game is fairly complex. Not as complex as say Pathfinder WotR, but for someone new to CRPGs you will still be overwhelmed very quickly, especially with the addition of the environment interaction (something WotR utterly lacks). Keep at it and you will eventually learn the systems and it will become so much fun!\n+- Can only concentrate on one concentration spell at a time, and there are tons of great ones to use. This means you will find a favorite, all around concentration spell (such as bless) that works in pretty much every battle and use only it, foregoing the other awesome concentration spells. Would have been great if it were balanced around being able to concentrate on two at a time.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- A game this massive and complex expect some bugs even now. But Larian continues to patch and improve things so that there are very few game breaking bugs left. Larian is still not done updating the game so I expect the worst offenders to get fixed eventually.\n- Some minor QOL complaints here and there, namely I wish we could make the text bigger and also more hotkeys for things like adding an item to wares.\n-I wish we could see the full build level up guide like what Pathfinder gives us. Instead you are forced to look at wikis to see how the class and subclass will advance. Inadvisable to go in blind unless you're playing easier than Tactician.\n- Lack of Tabaxi race.\n\nIf you are a fan of CRPGs this is an Absolute must buy even at full price.",

I can not stress this enough if you have not played this game YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON 1 OF THE BEST GAMES IN HISTORY!!!! I will recommend this game to everyone \n\nThis game was def the best game released in 2023, Best game I have played (well its tied between Elden Ring and FFXVI) in a long time. The story is so enriching and kept me locked in with every choice. Your experience may very but for me my first play through took me 94hrs to beat it....the first time.... Now that was me walking around and just looking at everything so you may actually beat it quicker than I. The character development is one of the best I have seen in a video game in a long time. I also never skipped any dialogue in my first play through so.... \n\nAs far as game play its a turn based RPG and top down action. You can walk around with 3 other friends or AI characters to help you as you find out what is causing the worst headache in the history of the world. You can romance certain characters if that is your thing (which Shadowheart and Karlack are.... baes) and have your own personalized experience. Gather loot via taking from npcs or by find it in chests like your standard rpg. Use spells or brute force your way to victory !!!!! \n\n\n",

There are a million different solutions to so many obstacles that you encounter - so many routes you can take that your playthrough really does feel uniquely [b]you[/b]. \n\nThe cast of characters also really shines through. Each of them are unique, memorable, and have distinct personalities that you'll grow to love. Everyone has a goal; and more importantly, has an opinion about what choices you make. Take your time and talk to them in between any events and you'll see what I mean. There is enough dialogue here to fill several novels. \n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. Of course.

        "review": "If you're looking for a game that's part epic storytelling, part chaotic fun, and full-on Dungeons & Dragons goodness, Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-try. Whether you're a seasoned tabletop player or completely new to D&D mechanics, this game is the perfect way to dive into the experience.\n\nFirst off, the game does an incredible job introducing D&D rules in a way that feels approachable but also stays true to the complexity of the tabletop experience. It's like a crash course in spells, abilities, and dice rolls, but in a fun, engaging way that never feels overwhelming. And the best part? You get to see how your decisions really affect the story and characters around you. Every little choice\u2014whether it\u2019s your race, class, or even background\u2014changes how NPCs react, the quests you get, and even the outcomes of certain situations. It\u2019s wild to see how much the smallest tweaks to your character build completely shift your game.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I haven\u2019t managed to finish a singleplayer campaign yet, and that\u2019s all thanks to my friends kidnapping me to join their campaigns. But who can blame them? The multiplayer experience is where the magic of this game really shines. The group dynamics you can create are nothing short of amazing. I\u2019ve been in campaigns with an entire party of bards (imagine a group of musical chaos), a band of halfling barbarians (tiny but mighty), a crew of completely evil characters, and even one where every character was themed around office skills (Durge was Jeff from HR, naturally). The flexibility and creativity this game allows for party composition is unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nBut what really blows my mind is the level of detail in dialogue and interactions. Changing something as simple as your race or subclass significantly impacts conversations in ways that constantly surprise me. The depth of the game world, paired with the sheer amount of content, makes it feel like you're playing in a world that's truly alive and responding to you. There\u2019s so much to explore, and I can\u2019t wait to finally dive into a singleplayer run, take my time, and savor every little detail.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that rewards creativity, offers insane replayability, and delivers an unforgettable experience whether you're flying solo or with friends. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to explore the chaotic beauty of D&D, this game is a perfect gateway!",

        "review": "I've never played DnD or many CRPGs before playing this game - I've long wished to play tabletop RPGs but was always too antisocial to have people to play with. This game provided me with an amazing experience that I couldn't have otherwise. It is not just a fantastic RPG, but a fantastic videogame period, certainly one of the best I've ever played. It is an extremely fun and engaging experience, with so many possibilities within all of its systems that you can't help but daydream about all the cool things you want to do next, even if you are still in the middle of your first playthrough. All of that is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is worth every penny of its price and absolutely worth trying out, even for those that have never played RPGs before.",
