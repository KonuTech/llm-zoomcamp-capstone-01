Then I found the \"Native Camera Tweaks\" mod on Nexus Mods.\n\nThis totally changes the game, allowing you to use standard 3rd person camera controls, and actually see what's ahead when moving up-hill.\n\nIt turns out all outdoor areas have sky boxes (including sun and moon), and almost all interior areas have ceilings.  Trust me, you'll hardly notice the few times a ceiling is missing or \"pops in\", unless you're looking for it.  And there's no performance hit that I've noticed.\n\nMakes me wander why Larian didn't give an unlocked camera by default...\n\nAlso you have full control over zoom/pitch/FoV/invert axis/dead zones etc through the mod's configuration file.\n\n[b][i]EDIT:  The mod has been updated (8 SEP 24) to work with patch 7.  Many thanks to Ersh for updating it so promptly!",

        "review": "I usually shun major AAA games in favor of small indie publishers. So when this game first came out and got a lot of attention, I ignored it, thinking it was overrated. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to give Baldur's Gate 3 a try. Boy, have I been missing out.\r\n\r\nGame play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons. There are nice tie-ins to the series that D&D players (including myself) will appreciate, such as certain races like elves and half-elves having dark vision, critical successes and critical failures, and classes like bards, wizards, and fighters. One key difference between the game and D&D is that in Baldur's Gate 3, instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn, initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat. Knowledge of D&D isn't required to play though, as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive.\r\n\r\nWhere the game really shines is all of its content. There are so many classes, paladin, barbarian, fighter, druid, cleric, bard, and monk, and just as many races too. Many classes and races also have sub-classes or sub-races, which allows in-depth customization of your characters. The only problem with this is customizing your first character (assuming you don't choose a pre-made one) can take a very long time, especially if you're indecisive like me. My first character Daelis, was a Wild Magic Sorcerer, and I had a cleric, fighter, and rogue in my party. Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe story was very enjoyable (no spoilers here!). You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with far-reaching consequences throughout, this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential. I liked how my party members' backstories diverged and intersected with the main story. Each character was well-written and fully-fleshed out, which made it feel like a real D&D campaign. There isn't much replayability when it comes to the main story. You can make different decisions, which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same. Unlike D&D there is only one campaign. Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second. Replayability is instead found in game play and quests. It's impossible to complete every quest, especially every party member's unique quests, in one play through. All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value. You can also recruit different party members than last time, resulting in new character interactions.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is saving in the game. There is an auto-save system, but it only activates after you enter important areas. You're forced to manually quick-save most of the time. I eventually got the hang of it, but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quick-save and lost progress. I played on the Balanced difficulty, which is essentially normal, and struggled during many fights. I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing. That's more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though. If you play a lot of casual games and don't have experience with RPGs, I'd recommend the Narrative or easy mode. Things will still be challenging, it's just your blood pressure won't spike as much.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good game for anyone who likes D&D or story-rich RPGs with lots of content.",

I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play, and oh boy was I wrong. This is truly a masterpiece; the level of depth in this game is insane. It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and D&D as a whole.\n\nAt first, the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me, resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone. But I'm glad it's there because it just makes it that much more replayable. This level of choice continues throughout the game, ensuring your experience is what you want it to be.\n\nMost of these longer story games end up tiring me out, so I just rush through to the end to not feel like I've wasted the time I spent on it already. BG3 is an exception to that; despite being the longest game out of all of them, I truly enjoyed the whole journey.\n\nBefore I even finished the game, I already couldn't wait to do another playthrough with mods and different choices.

        "review": "Baldur\u2019s Gate III is an isometric turn based action roleplaying game developed by Larian Studios of the Divinity Franchise fame. The origins for Baldur\u2019s Gate III itself starts back in 2001, with Black Isle Studios digging into development for the third game after Bioware\u2019s work on the first two Baldur\u2019s Gate games and Snowblind Studio\u2019s success on the spin-off Baldur\u2019s Gate: Dark Alliance. It apparently would have no returning Baldur\u2019s Gate characters and would tie into the Icewind Dale series along with the upcoming Dark Alliance 2. However, s h i t got f u c k ed up over at Interplay and they lost the rights to Dungeons and Dragons and had since decided to move onto the soon to be cancelled Van Buren project (aka Isometric Fallout 3). Soon afterwards, Interplay would continue to struggle repeatedly and would soon fall off of the gaming world amid lawsuits over the Baldur\u2019s Gate name, which would soon land on Atari of all things. There would be attempts at a revival by Brian Fargo (head of Interplay at that time) and Beamdog (the guys behind remastering BG1 & 2), but it would take a much longer time to find a home. This home would be Larian Studios, who would attempt to pitch Baldur\u2019s Gate III repeatedly to D&D owners Wizard of the Coast, and after the success of Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2, Wizards would give them the greenlight. They would tease the game in 2019 and release it in Early Access a couple of years later, even tying in an actual D&D prequel module named Baldur\u2019s Gate: Descent Into Avernus. \n\nMy introduction into Baldur\u2019s Gate III was one with little fanfare; I\u2019ve seen it around a whole bunch of times and I knew that the game was descended from a series whose roots delve into CRPG territory like Fallout and Planescape: Torment. Having seen it out in early access and had a couple of friends show interest, I bought it once or twice for them but hadn\u2019t thought anything of it since. However, Summer of 2023 had me fly overseas to the UK in honestly one of the best times of my life to meet up with some of my best friends. Talking about games in the living room of one of my friends, Wrathne had talked about the game a bit again as it was being released in August of that year. I made a mental note of it but nothing else and I flew back to go back to the depressing normal existence we call life. However, this game BLEW the hell up in both my personal life and the gaming world; everyone and my grandmother was playing this game and having seen it get the Game of the Year including my Gs BFD Survivor (a bit) and Wrathne. I had kinda brainstormed that perhaps I would get it so that we could do a cooperative campaign together someday, and after a bit of pestering I got the game from Wrathne for Christmas (shoutout to the Big Homie). I didn\u2019t really end up playing that until three months later but with someone else as everyone was either busy or was into other games at that time, and having been late to the party I figured \u201cwhy not\u201d and gave it a shot. \n\nI started this game as Dark Wizard Christofer Florentin, an ancient being whose main goal in life is to f u c k mad b i t c hes and show everyone who's boss. The game\u2019s writing is so damn good, I ended up monogamous with Shadowheart and saving the entire world instead of ruling it, becoming the Grey Wizard in the process. While to be fair, the game won\u2019t let you sleep with everyone unless you have mods, I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve done that anyways. All the characters are well written with fleshed out personalities, character motivations, goals, likeability, it\u2019s purely amazing what they\u2019ve done here and I don\u2019t even care for fantasy that much. I\u2019ve both cried a bit and giggled at the antics in game, shared numerous adventures with my party including dark elf ranger Elza the Taciturn (shoutout to Nibbles) and lizard ninja The Hand (shoutout to my roommate Austin) as we\u2019ve tackled ancient murder cults, lovecraftian monsters, serial killers, demons, robots, slavers, ogres and goblins and all kinds of random stuff. One minute you\u2019ll be hunting vampires for your bi-s e xual vampire buddy Astarion, the next minute you\u2019ll be attempting to stop a bank robbery. The best part? Every quest ties into each other whilst simultaneously having a personality of their own, and random encounters are everywhere with each location providing new things that one can\u2019t possibly see in their first playthrough. \n\nhttps://www.backloggd.com/u/gamemast15r/review/1896932/ (For pretty much most of the review, click here; most sources in this link but some are at bottom)\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate III was an RPG that I had picked up just to play cooperatively with some friends, a session that sadly I didn\u2019t end up doing but would love to make up some day. I ended up coming out of it glad it\u2019s finally over, but sad that I had to leave. I missed my grand adventure, watching as Elza the Taciturn would loot actual corpses to throw at bosses later on and trying to romance Shadowheart while convincing a group of elves to rise up against their slave masters. I miss this game even now. But wait, why not just replay it again? The first playthrough will always be a once in a lifetime impression, one that I\u2019d rather sit on and wait for a long time before re-discovering everything again in the future. It definitely made an impact on me, making me realize that I miss both the in-game friends I made as well as cherishing all the good times I\u2019ve had with my friends outside in the real world. The game and its world are the definition of fun, and this game went from a complete \u201ceh let\u2019s try it\u201d to \u201cthis is a certified hood classic, buy this mixtape out of the trunk of my non-existent car\u201d. Even if you think this game is a bunch of nerd fantasy s h i t or you don\u2019t like the style of game? Give it a try, Baldur\u2019s Gate III is a gem and is worth all the money you can possibly give and more. I didn\u2019t end up buying this game though technically, as stated my friend Wrathne got me a copy for Christmas of 2023, so shout out to the Big Homie for the copy. Baldur\u2019s Gate III is worth sixty dollars now, it was worth thirty dollars then, and it\u2019s worth whatever the amount of money you would like to throw at it; this game has become one of my favorites of all time and I feel sad for uninstalling the game. But when time grows apart, a longing to return home bubbles up and eventually I know I\u2019ll come back to this game for some cooperative fun. Hell, the next time I play this game all the way through, I\u2019ll probably write up the review to be a bit better because the truth is at the moment that I\u2019m VERY biased towards this game and feel like I could potentially do better, especially considering that there\u2019s so much content that I know I didn\u2019t even see it all.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated \nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/ \nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-september \nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/astarion-was-a-tiefling-in-an-early-version-of-baldurs-gate-3-gdc-panel-reveals \nhttps://www.belloflostsouls.net/2024/08/dd-beyond-walks-back-2024-changes.html#:~:text=Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast%20kicked,the%20new%20D%26D%202024%20ruleset. \nhttps://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-fans-win-ogl-controversy-good-wotc/ \nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/6JR4qLOXu96krMWxBTpXSR\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vofkw9-O18c&list=PLi1CK-rsvz1Nfz83RMBp_9YaIgBWd0l9x&index=2 \nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt13258344/ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9-xtPlIx7s&list=WL&index=99&t=6s \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDDrf2w6a10&list=WL&index=103&t=4s\nhttps://www.winterwind-productions.com/an-interview-with-damien-foletto-part-2/",

After investing over 370 hours, I can confidently say that it\u2019s been one of the most rewarding experiences I\u2019ve ever had in my +16 years of gaming!\n\nAs someone who\u2019s relatively new to games like Baldur's Gate 3, The game has done wonders in introducing me to the complexities of D&D within a digital realm. The adaptation of traditional tabletop mechanics into a seamless and engaging gameplay experience is nothing short of remarkableness.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the world of Faer\u00fbn feels alive and immersive, thanks to the stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The narrative is very engaging and full of twists, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful. The voice acting and character interactions are absolutely top-notch! Bringing the story and its inhabitants to life in a way that\u2019s truly memorable.\n\nWhat really sets Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 apart is its depth. With hundreds of quests, countless choices, and a variety of playstyles, there\u2019s always something new to discover. The replayability is off the charts! Each playthrough can be a completely different experience! The flexibility in character creation and party dynamics allows you to craft a unique adventure every time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of RPGs in general or just looking for a game that offers a rich, engaging experience, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is more than worth your time. My 370+ hours are a testament to its insane quality and replayability. This game has completely set a new standard for the genre! And I highly recommend it to anyone!\n\nThat said, if there is one \"downside\" that I could possible think of that is worth mentioning about Baldur's Gate 3, It has to be the fact that it may not be the most welcoming for players who are completely new to the D&D aspect of the game [u] (Like me!) [/u] . The depth and complexity of the D&D mechanics can be daunting quite a bit at first, and it takes some time to fully grasp the nuances if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the system. However, this challenge is also a blessing in disguise. It pushes you to learn and appreciate the intricacies of D&D, enriching your overall experience and deepening your understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics. If you\u2019re like me and are very excited to dive into the beauty of RPG with a truly remarkable blend with D&D, The feeling of immersion is something to totally embrace! \n\n[h3] ALSO! [/h3]\n\nI\u2019m incredibly excited to see what Patch 7 has in store and how it will further enhance this already amazing game! A huge shoutout to Larian Studios and everyone who worked on this project. Your dedication and passion have created an absolute masterpiece and This game is a testament to your incredible talent and hard work, and I\u2019m grateful for the unforgettable adventure you\u2019ve given us all! \n\n[b] From the bottom of my heart. Thank you SO SO much! \u2661 [/b]\n",

You have to deal with a rest system that is difficult to integrate in a natural game flow, the hit/miss mechanics that can make you play entire turns with no result, and a progression system that makes you choose between straight up improving your character or getting access to minor fun options. None of those make the game bad, but it makes you wonder how good the game would have been if it wasn't tainted by D&D.\n\ud83d\udcad Narratively it also suffers from being set in Forgotten Realms due to how much the worldbuilding relies on there being \"evil\" races to justify having default antagonists the player won't feel bad about killing. The game tries to timidly tackle the subject a few times, but all the goblins you see are still evil raiders, and it is never questioned.\n\n\u274c There is one major dissonance between what the narration conveys and what is expected from the player - the game sets up a huge feeling of urgency right from the start, pushing the player to hurry up and take as few breaks as possible, while a lot of the game's events actually need long rests to occur, and there are no downsides to resting (apart from possibly running out of resources, but that isn't really a factor either, you find a lot of food). Just know that there is no hurry, and you need to rest quite often to not miss interesting narrative content.\n\nOverall, Baldur's Gate 3 manages the feat of being a wonderful game despite being based on a mediocre game system and being set in a mediocre fantasy setting - you actually feel the amount of effort it took to swim against the current here and produce something so good in the end. It makes me even more optimistic about the next game by Larian Studios - if I could get any more optimistic after Divinity Original Sin 2.",

        "review": "Baldurs Gate 3 is by far one of the best games I've ever played in my life so far...I could stop there but I'll elaborate. This game just warms and hugs my D&D nerd heart...for this a game made for fans of D&D and every fantasy lover out there. The game lore is rich with so much details and bit and bobs to discover, the story is epic and will stay with me for the rest of life. Some of the best turn-based combat I've ever seen in a video game you have so many options of what you can do and you don't have to simply attack you can throw shit, jump, shove, light your sword on fire, throw a barrel of explosives, heal your ally by throwing a potion at them (it just works lol) and etc. It's so intricate and so well crafted...and lastly there's one other thing I wanna talk about...the companions...I will start with the order I met them don't worry I will be using spoiler texts. I really worry I may repeat shit for various characters lol\n\nLae'zel is an absolute unit, besides that she comes across as rude and not exactly friendly it's more like she comes from place where everyone had the attitude or that outlook and by all things that may point to the contrary...Lae'zel is the nicest githyanki alive..she's got a heart of gold under that armour, she's brave as all hell and she can be quite socially awkward and I love her...and she also happens to my favourite..whether she be dispatching foes as a fighter or the times I've changed her into a Paladin...god does she wreck people as a Paladin...\n\nShadowheart was the character I romanced with my first character and by god am I glad I did, Shadowheart is such a sweet person and she's very witty and the absolute best...like my god her story is so well done and I love watching her transform as a person throughout and various moments of quiet spent along her are moments well spent..and my god does she mess people up with that spirit guardians...favourite thing to do just sprint past enemies with spirit guardians up and just watch em all die...or wait for them to come to you lol\n\nAstarion is my favourite vampire spawn arsehole...not a spoiler literally everyone who plays the game can tell he is one..he's funny as all hell and very sarcastic and I just love this jackass and watching his story and my gawd his story was so fucking good like I can see why so many people on ArchiveofourOwn are obsessed with this man! (still don't get the love for Gortash thou...that man be evil) And my god is it good to always have a rogue at the handy!\n\nGale is charming as fuck...like my god the man could wax poetic shit and talk about magic and I'd listen to every word...god I really gotta romance the fuck out of this Bearded Wizardly Sage! Not much else to say besides I love him and I wanna romance him...\n\nWyll is the fucking best. Everyone whose ever said he's boring can go fuck off to Avernus! He's a folk hero to the truest he's got charm, he's got the sense of humour, he's got a sense of duty, he's got shady deal with an otherworldly patron (warlocks am I right?) and I just love this man...like I can't see why people dislike him. Wyll, Shadowheart and Lae'zel usually were my go to team throughout the game (mainly my first playthrough I'm mixing things up with my other playthroughs) like he is such a fun character and so useful my god...warlocks man Elderitch blast go brrrrr\n\nKarlach is an absolute cinnamon roll and like oh my gawd I'd take the second degree burns to give her a hug. I remember hearing somewhere she gives off autistic vibes and as someone with autism since I was 4 I was like...OOOOHHH that's why I get her so well LOL! But yeah she's the fucking best and having her by my side and just tanking so many hits and also dealing so much fucking damage was an absolute treat! \n\nNow we get into spoiler territory companions who I'll spoiler text here and there for!\n\nAct 2 Companion Spoilers\n[spoiler]Halsin is a giant man of muscle and meat and he's awesome, he's useful in battle no matter what and I love how caring he was for various things from nature to whittling wooden ducks. Also got to romance him alongside Shadowheart my first playthrough! Hurrah for Polyamory! Also god dam did having a man who can turn into an owl bear on your side at any moment help! [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Minthara could step on me and I wouldn't complain lol! Her voice my god...also awesome character. She's serious as but also very stoically funny and she has so many good lines from the one about the Drider wedding to various other hits. She's so handy and it's very elaborate way to recruit her in a good play-through by the knocking her out in act 1 while in battle and freeing her act 2 in moonrise but apparently I haven't gotten to see it myself it's easier now after patch 7...can't wait to look more into that but yeah she's awesome Paladin in BG3 is...very OP and it's always good to have her on hand...admittedly I did kill her first playthrough (didn't know at the time) but every other playthrough I did knock her out...[/spoiler]\n\nAct 3 Companion spoilers! Again don't read this if you don't want to be spoiled\n[spoiler]Jaehira is blast to have on your side, having a wise and cranky old hero but still wisecracking is such a treat and I would never say no to two druids on the team. Not much else to say but she's awesome and she's a fun addition to the team I couldn't live without. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]...I would die for Minsc...he is the best...I understand why people love him...cause I agree....he is...so fucking funny and he's also such a badass and I just...god I love this himbo and his space hamster...and that sentence alone is wild but just...he's the best he's so fucking awesome and Matt Mercer voices him to and oh my gawd..[/spoiler]\n\nAnd uhhhh yeah that's....well my long rant about the companions too...I can't think about what else I wanted to talk about like yeah the music is also amazing, the choices in this game matter and there is...so many of them my god...like...this game really is basically videogame D&D...pretty close to it anyway...I....I'm gonna play this a lot more to see what other things I can discover...from quests or plot-hooks or romances (especially the romances my god I wanna see the Lae'zel romance play out cause it is GOOD) and I still have yet to touch any of the online co-op which will change in about a couple weeks really excited for that and yeah....fucking amazing work Larian I know your not working on BG4 and while I adore this game I don't really mind because I can't wait to see what you all come up with next! If you have the money to spare and the time whether it be after work or school or on the weekend or during the holidays...I highly recommend playing Baldurs Gate 3...",

I could go on and on but for the people who are unsure. Trust me on this. Its phenomenal!",

        "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 is the best CRPG ever made, and definitely of the best games ever made. Phenomenal writing, story, characters, world building, voice acting, and amount of detail crammed into this adventure is incredible. The sheer number of ways you can approach situations in and out of combat still blows my mind; I would absolutely love to see how Larian designed and programmed this game to accommodate for all of the different interactions and decisions you make along the 200+ hours it took me to complete the game and 99% of the quests. \n\nWhile I'm not the biggest turn-based combat fan (or know the rules of D&D), the strategy of it encourages you to try and think outside of the box at times. This becomes rewarding when you successfully complete a longer combat encounter using a mixture of magic/items to manipulate the game environment to your advantage when zerg-rushing and left-click attacking might not be viable. The amount of replayability is insanely high; I dare you to try a fully evil playthrough after a \"good\" playthrough and see if you can stomach some of the decisions you'll need to make! It's going to be tough to try and top a RPG like this, but I can't wait to see what Larian is working on next.",

As it turns out, I'm not really a fan of turn-based combat. Even Pathfinder was not my cup of tea. So I stayed away from this game for a long time after it came out. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, when some vampire twink kept showing up in my TikTok feed. The character writing was good . . . The art style looked amazing . . . \n\nFine. I'll play the stupid game. But I didn't expect to enjoy it. \n\nFast forward again to me having over 200 hours in 6 months. Holy shit . . . I don't think there's a single companion character that I don't care about. They all have compelling personalities. The story is fun and engaging. It's like your own little D&D game. You can play by yourself or with friends. If you're not creative, you can even play as one of the companion characters. There's a bunch of different endings, so it really feels like your choices impact the story. And even now, over a year after the release, Larian is still adding more content. I'm so glad I gave this game a chance, because it is now one of my favorite games ever. And I know that I will have plenty to still discover when I do another play-through.

Each and every time I have started a play-through and gotten to Act 3, I have found something new that I didn't experience from a previous run. There are so many interesting lore bits tied around DnD that are just such a joy to see and interact with. If you have ever played DnD (Dungeons and Dragons), this is most likely going to be an ABSOLUTE blast for you, and for those of you that have never played it, this will probably a bit of a new experience for you (preferably in a good way). A turn based game with a \"Choose your own adventure\" sort of build, and more than simply fight your way out allowing you to choose different means to succeed. \nFascinating characters (please don't sleep on Wyll, he's actually really great!), fun world to enjoy. Easily deserving of GOTY multiple times over!",

        "review": "Much like Dark Souls, this game had such a profound impact on me that it changed my life. Not in a good way - now I just compare every game to Baldur's Gate 3 and get depressed when they can't hold a candle to it. I'm sure for years we will all be chasing the high that was our first play though of this game - having to cope with the crippling feeling of knowing everything else pales in comparison. \n\nThis game is absolutely massive. MASSIVE. Not just map size - the possibilities are massive as well. I have 100 hours in this game and I didn't do everything there is to do. (yes my playtime says 150 hours but my 2 year old son would not stop turning the game on, I guess he loves it too.) Even if I had done everything I could do in a single playthrough - that still leaves out an enormous amount of different decisions I could have made throughout the game. So many choices, skill checks, missed areas - all yet to be experienced by the time you see the credits roll for the first time. Not only that, but there are dozens upon dozens of builds you can do in this game. There is a nigh infinite amount of replayability for the character builds alone.\n\nThe absolute best part of this game however is the intimate character interactions. Motion captured and fully voiced, dialogues take an over-the-shoulder perspective instead of opting to stay at an isometric view. This enhances the experience immensely. Couple this with the plethora of things to do in the game - *[i]chefs kiss[/i]* - just incredible.\n\nMy only regret is now that I've played it, I can never play it for the first time EVER AGAIN. I call this this \"Attack on Titan dilemma.\"\n\n",

        "review": "This is the best CRPG I have ever played, beating out even all the Bioware/Interplay classics. This game is so good it ruins other CRPGs because it makes them look boring and simple.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n+ Dialogues aren't boring text boxes with a voice over you can out-read. Instead they are over the shoulder or sometimes a little more cinematic. This brings you into the conversation much better than a text box. I actually turned off the subtitles so I don't get distracted and can stay immersed.\n+ This game has the greatest amount of choice and consequence I have ever seen in any game. Virtually every quest can be completed in multiple ways. You are constantly given multiple dialogue options that usually have some kind of impact on the conversation beyond slightly changed dialogue. Say the wrong things and you can start a fight, end it amicably, or perhaps some other consequence. Karlach is so physically hot she can't be touched. What about a fire resistance potion? Surely the game wouldn't react to that... try it :). The encounter in act 1 to enter the tombs where you find a certain NPC can be approached in four, yes four, ways, each granting you unique dialogue depending on the direction you approach. Can you figure out the fourth way? And many, many more things.\n+ Reactivity to your race, class, and Origin character. You sometimes get unique dialogue options and NPC responses depending on those. True though it rarely changes much (unless you're Dark Urge) but it's still fun and huge for roleplaying.\n+ Environment interaction and reactivity is unprecedented. So many ways to play with the environment including for solving quests or manipulating battles. When no one is looking quickly pick up a locked chest so you can open it somewhere safe. Use Mage Hand to scout and manipulate objects safely. And much more.\n+ I didn't care for Origin characters in DOS2, but here they feel much more fun, not just to play as but also as companions to talk to and adventure with. All of them are memorable to me.\n+ Immensely replayable, not just thanks to the above but also with all the classes and the multiple ways to play them.\n+ No predatory practices like microtransactions or content cut then sold as DLC. What you see is what you get, and what you get is one of the best deals in gaming.\n+ Despite what some people try to claim the game is NOT full of wokeness. Yes the companions are player-sexual meaning they are attracted to you no matter who you are, so this means the power of who to romance is in your hands. Also unlike what some people say it's very easy to tell when a companion is hitting on you, so just say no if you don't like it. Furthermore if there's any characters that offend you, virtually everyone in the game is killable (even your companions). Have fun!\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n+- While the game overall is the best CRPG, the writing falls a tad short compared to the classics of old. This is due to the fact that every character line plus the narrator is voiced, so we don't get the long, eloquent descriptions and detailed conversations we got in the past. But the writing here is still good, certainly better than pretty much any AAA game nowadays. And having everything voiced with the cinematic camera makes the conversations far more immersive than a mere text box no matter how well written it is.\n+- The game is fairly complex. Not as complex as say Pathfinder WotR, but for someone new to CRPGs you will still be overwhelmed very quickly, especially with the addition of the environment interaction (something WotR utterly lacks). Keep at it and you will eventually learn the systems and it will become so much fun!\n+- Can only concentrate on one concentration spell at a time, and there are tons of great ones to use. This means you will find a favorite, all around concentration spell (such as bless) that works in pretty much every battle and use only it, foregoing the other awesome concentration spells. Would have been great if it were balanced around being able to concentrate on two at a time.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- A game this massive and complex expect some bugs even now. But Larian continues to patch and improve things so that there are very few game breaking bugs left. Larian is still not done updating the game so I expect the worst offenders to get fixed eventually.\n- Some minor QOL complaints here and there, namely I wish we could make the text bigger and also more hotkeys for things like adding an item to wares.\n-I wish we could see the full build level up guide like what Pathfinder gives us. Instead you are forced to look at wikis to see how the class and subclass will advance. Inadvisable to go in blind unless you're playing easier than Tactician.\n- Lack of Tabaxi race.\n\nIf you are a fan of CRPGs this is an Absolute must buy even at full price.",

        "review": "If you're looking for a game that's part epic storytelling, part chaotic fun, and full-on Dungeons & Dragons goodness, Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-try. Whether you're a seasoned tabletop player or completely new to D&D mechanics, this game is the perfect way to dive into the experience.\n\nFirst off, the game does an incredible job introducing D&D rules in a way that feels approachable but also stays true to the complexity of the tabletop experience. It's like a crash course in spells, abilities, and dice rolls, but in a fun, engaging way that never feels overwhelming. And the best part? You get to see how your decisions really affect the story and characters around you. Every little choice\u2014whether it\u2019s your race, class, or even background\u2014changes how NPCs react, the quests you get, and even the outcomes of certain situations. It\u2019s wild to see how much the smallest tweaks to your character build completely shift your game.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I haven\u2019t managed to finish a singleplayer campaign yet, and that\u2019s all thanks to my friends kidnapping me to join their campaigns. But who can blame them? The multiplayer experience is where the magic of this game really shines. The group dynamics you can create are nothing short of amazing. I\u2019ve been in campaigns with an entire party of bards (imagine a group of musical chaos), a band of halfling barbarians (tiny but mighty), a crew of completely evil characters, and even one where every character was themed around office skills (Durge was Jeff from HR, naturally). The flexibility and creativity this game allows for party composition is unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nBut what really blows my mind is the level of detail in dialogue and interactions. Changing something as simple as your race or subclass significantly impacts conversations in ways that constantly surprise me. The depth of the game world, paired with the sheer amount of content, makes it feel like you're playing in a world that's truly alive and responding to you. There\u2019s so much to explore, and I can\u2019t wait to finally dive into a singleplayer run, take my time, and savor every little detail.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that rewards creativity, offers insane replayability, and delivers an unforgettable experience whether you're flying solo or with friends. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to explore the chaotic beauty of D&D, this game is a perfect gateway!",

It is an extremely fun and engaging experience, with so many possibilities within all of its systems that you can't help but daydream about all the cool things you want to do next, even if you are still in the middle of your first playthrough. All of that is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is worth every penny of its price and absolutely worth trying out, even for those that have never played RPGs before.",

Even though I've played for 150+ hours, I'm still only at the beginning of Act 3, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of different ways to play. I feel like I've only seen 20% of the content in my playthrough! That makes me so excited to make new classes and start over...maybe on a harder difficulty next time!",

What can I say that others haven't said before? if anyone is reading this and is on the fence about the game for whatever reason, just try it. I HATE strategy games and I didn't like DND when I played it irl. This game made me love both ironically. I wish I could do this game service with a proper review but all I need to say is I don't make reviews often, You can check. This game is the few that deserve one.",

The scale, the detail, the role-playing potential, the endless creative problem-solving, the writing, the performances, the music... It hits every mark to a degree so beyond anything else that's out there. I'm truly at a loss for words. This feels like that dream game I used to always wonder about as a kid as to the possibility of something like this existing while I'm alive. And yet, here it is. In all its glory.\n\nThey achieved it. DnD: The Video Game",

Most of the mods have not been uploaded, any mods from outside are flagged, the ui isn't great. If you look at a mod it returns you to page one, you can't even jump pages browsing mods, so if you look at a mod on page 20 you need to go page by page to get back to 20 and continue browsing. All previous saves are dead.\nNew with last update: if you hit page 10 or 11, the mod browser thinks you're on page 1 again! You physically can't get to page 12, and even if you could, it would still think you're on page 1!",
