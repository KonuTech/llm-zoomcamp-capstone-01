So many weird limits and choices in development that make no sense. Not lack of development, but straight up restrictions that make the game less fun (can't change weapons, can't buy cars, extremely boring and limited hacking).\n\nEven without playing the previous 2 games, it overall has a pretty bad feeling. The cyberpunk elements don't really fit into the world, they stick out like a sore thumb. \n\nVoice acting is awful, and general writing gets worse the more you play. The whole point is that there is no main character, you just switch between them. But the characters can't even cooperate on missions and they almost never interact, so you basically just switch between characters with different skills (and the skills arent so amazingly different that you care to play more than 1-2 characters).",

Gameplay is very janky, story looked like it was written by a disgruntled redditor and the monetization is just something else.

An average story. \r\n\r\nMechanics \u2013 9/10 - Really solid mechanics. Things like unlocking new tech, parkour, and the seamless hacking throughout the game is very smooth and enjoyable, lovely mechanics. \r\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 6/10 - Had a few great characters like Wrench and Aiden. \r\n\r\nControls \u2013 7/10 - Great smooth controls. No complaints. \r\n\r\nGraphics \u2013 8/10 - Beautiful graphics that really capture London. Was also able to run this game with great performance. All High settings running at around 70-80 FPS. \r\n\r\nMusic \u2013 4/10 - The soundtrack didn't exactly stick out, had some decent songs on the radio. Nothing special. \r\n\r\nPacing \u2013 4/10 - Felt like a drag at some points and pacing didn't seem too consistent. \r\n\r\nSetting \u2013 8/10 - Love the setting in London. Very beautiful and well captured. \r\n\r\nMissions \u2013 5/10 - Main missions and side missions were repetitive and didn\u2019t really have too much to them. Usually just shooting shit up or being stealthy. Had some good missions though, certain ones. \r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts / Rating \u2013 6.3/10 - Overall the main things that stuck out to me in Watch Dogs Legions were the mechanics and setting. I loved the hacking mechanics, parkour, the fact you can literally be anyone on the street and gunplay, and the setting of London was beautiful. Had a great character, Wrench. The actual story, missions, and pacing were nothing special. Overall enjoyed this game, and love the Watch Dogs franchise.",

Unfortunately, the lack of a first person mode and some jankiness with the cutscenes takes away from some of that & there are some problems with the gameplay that others have covered enough for me not to get into it. 4.2 / 5 -- and I have high hopes for wd 3/4",

The release of Shadows has been pushed back to February, but it\u2019s unlikely that will give the game much of a lifeline. There\u2019s speculation that Guillemot may be orchestrating a drop in [i]Ubisoft\u2019s[/i] stock price to consolidate a controlling stake. Regardless, I went ahead and picked up a few dozen shares while the opportunity presents itself.\n\nAs for [b]Watch Dogs: Legion[/b]\u2014it's not so bad. It's worth the $5 sale price. The city is fantastic, especially when you're racing through it in the rain, the sky dimmed by a murky orange sunset, neon signs flickering in puddles below. Sure, the NPCs are dumb as bricks, and the missions lack originality, but I\u2019m looking at this from an architectural angle. And futuristic London? It\u2019s genuinely a marvel.\n\nAt its core, what you're getting for this price is a pack of assets simulating a city of the future. The details stand out, particularly when compared with [i]Assassin's Creed Syndicate[/i]. Essentially, [i]Ubisoft[/i] is shuffling players through different time periods, and this journey costs less than a budget flight on Wizz Air, Ryanair, or EasyJet.\n\nEverything else about the game is, frankly, terrible. The story? Naah. The enemy AI? Laughable. The character customization? So poorly done that you have no idea who to pick by default. The soundtrack? Middle-of-the-road at best. Cut scenes? Awful. The voice acting, unfortunately, feels mismatched\u2014poorly chosen voices that don\u2019t suit the default characters, with dialogue that doesn\u2019t quite sync with the lip movements.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what becomes of the Guillemot brothers\u2019 legacy. For now, the quality of products leaves much to be desired.",

        "review": "Watch Dogs: Legion is an ambitious and exhilarating entry in the Watch Dogs franchise. Set in a beautifully rendered near-future London, the game stands out for its unique \"Play as Anyone\" system, which allows you to recruit and control any NPC in the world. This mechanic is a true game-changer, providing endless possibilities for creative gameplay, and making each playthrough feel fresh and personal.\r\n\r\nThe variety of characters you can recruit\u2014from hackers to construction workers to grandmas\u2014brings a fun, dynamic element to missions. Each character comes with their own set of skills, traits, and personalities, offering new strategies for tackling objectives. The game encourages experimentation, and there\u2019s a real sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to use a seemingly unorthodox recruit to complete a mission.\r\n\r\nLondon itself is gorgeously crafted, blending iconic landmarks with dystopian flair. The attention to detail in the environments, combined with a compelling storyline that tackles relevant themes of surveillance, authoritarianism, and resistance, gives the game both depth and immediacy.\r\n\r\nThe missions are well-designed, offering a mix of stealth, combat, and hacking challenges. Whether you're infiltrating a corporate stronghold or liberating a borough from an oppressive regime, the game rewards ingenuity and adaptability. The inclusion of cooperative multiplayer further extends the game's replayability, letting you team up with friends to cause chaos or complete objectives.\r\n\r\nOverall, Watch Dogs: Legion is a thrilling and innovative experience that brings new life to open-world games. Its emphasis on player freedom, combined with a rich setting and engaging story, makes it a must-play for fans of the genre and newcomers alike.",

        "review": "Watch Dogs Legion is an interesting insight into a dystopian city that has fallen down the rabbit hole and nobody seems to find a way out. First of all, the innovative (albeit a bit flawed) Play As Anyone mechanic introduced in the video game allows players to recruit virtually any non-playable character in the open world, each bringing unique skills, backgrounds, and personalities to the fight against oppression. The roleplaying implications are vast, as you can immerse yourself in the lives of everyday Londoners, from construction workers and cryptocurrency analysts to paramedics and pickpockets, shifting your playstyle with each character. This mechanic encourages creative approaches to missions (in the simplest possible ways if you so desire) and fosters a deep connection to the individuals you recruit, making the rebellion against authoritarianism feel truly communal and diverse.\n\nThe factions in Watch Dogs Legion paint a vivid picture of the powers at play in dystopian London. DedSec, the group you belong to, is a grassroots resistance trying to free the city from the grip of oppressive organizations. Albion, a private military contractor, enforces martial law, symbolizing the rise of corporate-controlled security forces. Clan Kelley operates in the shadows, profiting off of London's underworld through human trafficking and black market deals. Meanwhile, the Signals Intelligence Response Service (SIRS), the intelligence agency, wields control over mass surveillance, presenting a chilling representation of how governments can abuse technology for control. Each faction not only serves as a formidable antagonist but also represents a different aspect of totalitarian rule, from corporate to criminal to governmental.\n\nSkye Larsen's story arc encapsulates the game's exploration of transhumanism, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. As the visionary behind advanced artificial intelligence and the leader of Project Daybreak (a project that aims to upload human consciousness into machines), Skye Larsen's ambitions raise ethical questions about identity, mortality, and the price of immortality. Her storyline serves as the darkest example of how technology in the wrong hands can dehumanize and exploit life itself. Skye Larsen's character and her experiments on her own family force players to confront the ethical nightmare of playing God, making her one of the most disturbing and tragic figures in Watch Dogs Legion.\n\nLondon, as reimagined in Watch Dogs Legion, is a masterclass in world-building, capturing the essence of the city while painting it in a dystopian light. Iconic landmarks such as the Tower of London, Camden Market, and Westminster Abbey are seamlessly integrated into a future where drones, surveillance cameras, and propaganda posters are omnipresent. The streets feel alive with the tension of a city under siege, from graffiti depicting resistance movements and Albion Contractors arresting innocent civilians in the streets after an identity check to automated checkpoints manned by Albion drones and Clan Kelley Associates harassing citizens to enforce their authority in controlled territories. This version of London feels both familiar and unsettling, a city at once modern and trapped under the weight of technological authoritarianism.\n\nThe documents scattered throughout the video game's open world and various missions enrich the narrative, giving players deeper insight into the lives of both the oppressors and the oppressed. Audio logs, text files, relics and dialogues reveal the motivations behind the factions, the corruption within the system, and the personal stories of those suffering under Albion and Clan Kelley's rule. These collectibles add layers to the main plot, providing context to major events and fleshing out characters who might otherwise seem one-dimensional or who don't even appear in the video game but played a crucial role in illustrating the violence in a dangerous dystopian London. Collecting these pieces of hidden lore rewards players with a fuller understanding of the world and the true stakes of DedSec's fight for freedom.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion, as a narrative video game (if you have this approach in mind when playing it), is a powerful reminder that in the face of overwhelming oppression, it is not just heroes who rise up, but everyday people who are united in the belief that together, they can reclaim their future.",

The other character get's into prison/hospital and you need to wait (usually) 15 IRL minutes to be able to deploy again. If you can role-play into these characters, it's great, however sometimes they just can't themselves. I had a spy who in a mission with speaking to other spies and acted completely clueless on what spies are doing. Also voices acting is quite bad, silent protagonists would have been so much more enjoyable.\n\nOther than that I had a blast, great game. No achievements unfortunately so I didn't invest in collecting everything.\n\n(Played on Steam Deck, runs great, couple of crashes here and there but smooth enough. Eats the battery though and you need the Ubisoft launcher to start)",
