        "review": "Overall: 8.75/10\n\nStory:\n\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker's career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter\u2019s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\nThe game\u2019s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It\u2019s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man\u2019s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the 'Batman: Arkham' series.\nThe game's skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don't have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\nHowever, the gameplay isn\u2019t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game's otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\n\nWorld: \n\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man\u2019s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\n\nVisuals:\n\nHaving previously played 'Spider-Man (2018)' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections\u2014especially with ray tracing enabled\u2014adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they\u2019re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\n\nMusic/Sound Design:\n\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game\u2019s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen\u2014intensifying during combat or when you\u2019re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man's web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it\u2019s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker\u2019s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker's personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it's obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\n\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:(",

        "review": "I am not the biggest Spidey-fan and originally had no intentions set on playing this game. However, Spider-Man Remastered was an amazing experience, well worth the time and money. The movement system is so intuitive and engaging that I actively avoided fast travel. Navigating the immense city by swinging between buildings and launching over rooftops, I explored Manhattan while pushing the near perfect physics of this game to their limits. Separate skill-trees and a multitude of upgradable gadgets expand and enhance gameplay and combat, while unlocking alternative suits also provides unique, ultimate, abilities for a variety of custom options. Combat can be punishing for button mashers, but is exciting when completing enemy bases or achieving that perfect combo. The Spidey-sense mechanic for dodging is a bit wonky, working well early in game, but eventually becoming misleading. Stealth is not always flawless, but mastery of this essential skill is required to completing some story missions and sniper eliminations. The DLC was not as enjoyable and the screwball challenges were ridiculously repetitive, but overall Spider-Man Remastered was a fantastic game. If your a fan of the web-slinger I would definitely give this one a shot.",

The web swinging is intuitive and feels phenomenal, and the combat makes really good use of Spiderman's powers. While the open world activities can get a bit repetitive, the base mechanics of the game are so well done that I had no problems doing the open world activities (even when I didn't need the crafting resources) and even swinging around instead of just fast traveling. The main plotline and characters are also of course well done.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous with all settings and ray tracing set to max on an OLED ultrawide with HDR on. The PS5 DualSense controller also supports the enhanced haptics and trigger effects when plugged in with USB. I'm glad that I decided to wait for the PC port rather than play it on my PS5, as if you have the high end hardware to push this game it really shines.",

I was extremely excited to play this and so far it hasn't disappointed me in the slightest. The story is fun and fresh, the graphics are pretty sweet, and the game-play feels smooth and superhero-like. Although, this game never really felt new to me it reminds me heavily of the Batman Arkham games and the combat feels nearly identical. Even besides this fact the game has kept me extremely engaged over the course of around 40 hours.",

DONT support this Publisher.\n\nABOUT THE GAME ITSELF:\nA nice hero game ruined by terrible writing. I will go into more details below.\n\nCONS:\n* The writing - they should have renamed it to The Twitter Man. Spider man and other characters constantly bombard you with \"jokes\" if you can call them that. Makes you feel cringe. After playing this game I started doubting myself, maybe it was always like this, maybe its not the games fault but mine, I was young and my perception simply changed. It made me go back and watch the 2002 movie. After rewatching, I can say Spider-man definitely wasn't always retarded and its the games fault.\n* Generic open world - It has bunch of same event copy pasted and you are handed the chore list. If you like ubisoft games, then this might be a positive to you, because its actually slightly better than usual.\n\nPROS:\n* Gameplay - While no one is talking, you feel like spider man. The traversal is nice and the combat is simple but good enough for a spider man game.\n* The Graphics - The NY city looks great, especially during night time. Feels good just to web around the city.\n*Cinematography - The action cutscenes are shot masterfully.\n\nIn general I would recommend the game if you just want to play a casual super hero open world game. Its alright. I would not recommend it if you care about spider-man as a character.",

They know how to pace them well so that you're encourages to take all of them throughout your playthrough\n\n- The swinging felt limited at times, particularly when trying to travel in the vertical plane.\n- For some reason, the game always crash on me if I tried to enter a particular area (that I presumed is due to some DLC hijinks).\n- There is no bossfight with intense back-to-back fighting, cinematic yeah, but definitely not intense.\n- A lot of crimes become repetitive after you've done quite a few of them.\n",

From the first mission, the tutorial makes movement in this game feel like Spiderman. I have had a few weird graphical bugs and audio bugs, but I noticed that when I put my steam deck (OLED) to sleep, and boot it back up in game, that is what appears to cause it. That was only a few missions though. Other wise the frame rate is smooth and graphics are crystal. I am only 7 hours in but the story has me hooked, to the point I am sitting at work waiting to get off to play. Haven't felt that in a game in a minute. Solid 9.5/101 from me.",
