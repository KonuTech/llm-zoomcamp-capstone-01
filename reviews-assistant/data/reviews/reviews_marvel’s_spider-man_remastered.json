        "review": "Overall: 8.75/10\n\nStory:\n\nSpider-Man Remastered is an open world action-adventure game that delivers an engaging, character-driven story that expertly blends superhero action with personal drama. Set eight years into Peter Parker's career as Spider-Man, the narrative masterfully intertwines Peter\u2019s personal life with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, while acknowledging the delicate balance between his life as a superhero and his personal life and relationships, delivering a story rich with emotional depth.\nThe game portrays Peter as an experienced superhero juggling his role as a protector of New York with his struggles in everyday life, creating a compelling dual narrative. His relationships with many recognizable key characters are deeply explored, adding layers of personal stakes to the story.\nThe game\u2019s villain lineup is also very well-developed, offering intricate motivations that raise the tension as the plot unfolds. The pacing is near perfect, keeping you engaged through both thrilling action sequences and most quieter, character-driven moments. As events escalate, the narrative deftly balances themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and hope, creating a truly cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. It\u2019s an engaging narrative that feels both intimate and epic, setting a high standard for superhero storytelling in gaming.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe core gameplay here excels in its fluidity and excitement. Swinging through New York City is a fun, fast, and incredibly smooth. The web-swinging mechanics make traversal feel exhilarating and seamless, with the layout of the buildings perfectly suited for navigation, giving a real sense of momentum and control. Combat is another very significant highlight, With Spider-Man\u2019s agility and web abilities making every fight dynamic by offering a mix of acrobatic, gadget-based attacks and strategic thinking, making the whole system very reminiscent of the 'Batman: Arkham' series.\nThe game's skill tree and progression system provide meaningful upgrades that keep gameplay fresh, but the enemy types don't have the greatest variety and can feel slightly repetitive by the end of the game. Side activities, like collecting backpacks or taking on hideouts, are rewarding without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of opportunities to engage with the world at your own pace.\nHowever, the gameplay isn\u2019t without its drawbacks. The sections where you play as Miles Morales and Mary Jane feel painfully underwhelming. These stealth-focused segments, while short, disrupt the fast-paced momentum and excitement of being Spider-Man. They often feel like unnecessary filler, lacking the thrill that defines the rest of the game. While I can appreciate the variety in gameplay, I often found myself wondering, \"Why is this not just a cutscene?\" during these sequences.\nAdditionally, the random crimes scattered throughout the city become rather repetitive over time. While they offer some quick action between main missions, the lack of variety in objectives and enemy encounters makes them feel like a chore after a while, slightly diminishing the game's otherwise fantastic open-world experience.\n\nWorld: \n\nThe world design of Spider-Man Remastered is one of its standout features, offering a vibrant and detailed recreation of New York City. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling streets below, the city feels alive, with NPCs, traffic, and subtle environmental details adding to the immersion. There is clearly thought put into every corner, making the open world feel like a playground tailored to Spider-Man\u2019s abilities. Each district in New York is distinct, with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, and more scattered across the map, encouraging exploration. The attention to detail in the small things like reflections in windows, environmental designs, etc. all create a living, breathing city that feels responsive.\nIn Spite of the impressive and beautifully crafted design though, the open-world structure can sometimes fall into the trap of open-world fatigue, where the repetitive activities diminishes the sense of discovery.\n\nVisuals:\n\nHaving previously played 'Spider-Man (2018)' on PS4 years ago and being visually impressed back then, I was very pleasantly surprised at how Spider-Man Remastered showcases its very noticeably improved visuals that elevate the entire experience even further than before. The city of New York is stunning in detail, making it feel vibrant and alive. The attention to detail in the textures, lighting, and reflections\u2014especially with ray tracing enabled\u2014adds an extra layer of realism, allowing the city to shine both day and night. Whether swinging at high speed or exploring the ground level, the visual fidelity is impressive.\nCharacter models are intricately designed, with highly expressive faces that capture subtle emotions, enhancing both gameplay and storytelling. The updated visuals in the remaster breathe new life into the characters, particularly during cutscenes, which are incredibly cinematic. These sequences feel like they\u2019re straight out of a high-budget Marvel movie, with seamless transitions between gameplay and narrative moments, keeping you fully immersed.\nOn the technical side, this port offers plenty of options to adjust the performance to your needs. The higher frame rates and resolution make the already beautiful world even more impressive; However, on lower-end systems, some graphical features may need to be scaled back, which could slightly detract from the experience.\n\nMusic/Sound Design:\n\nThe music and sound design in Spider-Man Remastered play a crucial role in enhancing the game\u2019s immersion and emotional impact; The soundtrack perfectly captures the heroic spirit of Spider-Man. The orchestral score dynamically shifts to match the action on screen\u2014intensifying during combat or when you\u2019re web-swinging through the city, and calming down during quieter, emotional moments. All the music evokes a sense of wonder and excitement, adding to the cinematic quality of the game.\nIn terms of sound design, every element feels finely tuned to heighten your experience. The iconic sound effect of Spider-Man's web-shooters, the satisfying impacts of punches during combat, and the ambient sounds of New York City all blend together seamlessly. Whether it\u2019s the movement of pedestrians or the distant hum of traffic, the world feels alive thanks to the layered soundscape. Even small details, like the wind rushing past as you swing through the city, help you feel truly connected to the environment.\nVoice acting is another standout, with performances that breathe life into the characters. Peter Parker\u2019s quips during fights, the emotional weight of conversations, and even the in-game podcast chatter all feel natural and contribute to the storytelling.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nSpider-Man Remastered delivers a thrilling experience with a rich, emotional narrative that masterfully balances Peter Parker's personal struggles with his duties as a superhero. The gameplay shines with its fluid web-swinging and dynamic combat, though the stealth sections with Miles and Mary Jane, as well as repetitive random crimes, disrupt the otherwise exhilarating and fast-paced excitement. The open-world design beautifully recreates New York City, but it sometimes falls into common open-world tropes. Visually, the game excels, with stunning ray-traced reflections, detailed character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance the immersion, complemented by a soundtrack that perfectly contributes to the action and sound design that adds depth. While there are minor pacing issues, Spider-Man Remastered stands out as a visually stunning plus engaging superhero game and with all these things considered and being not just one of my favorite superhero games, but one of my favorite games PERIOD, it's obvious that I think this is a title EVERYONE needs their hands on!\n\nALSO SONY, BRING SPIDER-MAN 2 TO PC >:(",

Firstly, the game has very rebatative activities in the open world, in other words, a lot of single marks on the map (at first it's cool, but there are too many of them, and by the end it gets really boring). Secondly, the plot is a typical superhero plot (only morons won't be irritated by its stupidity). And the last significant disadvantage is that the dynamic gameplay for Spider-Man is diluted with dull quests for Mary Jane and Miles Morales.\nOf course, the game has many advantages, because of which I recommend this game: very pleasant combat (dynamic, beautiful, exciting), although by the last chapter it got boring. Another huge advantage is the open world, in the sense that it is very beautiful. Overall, the game is really interesting to play, everything is beautiful and interesting, with the exception of a few of the above-described downsides.",

        "review": "I really enjoyed playing as Spider-Man. I cannot overstate enough how much fun it is to just swing around the city and save people. The story was quite good and integrated Spider-Man villains in a engaging way. I liked that you got to fight some big villains and the classic \"hey give me your money\" muggers. The DLC was integrated in this remastered PC version of the game and was also quite enjoyable as I do love Black Cat (who doesn't???). I thought that swinging around the map and completing all of the map markers, objectives, etc was engaging and didn't feel too repetitive OUTSIDE OF the stupid Screwball challenges. I hated those so much more than I can properly express. They were one of the last achievements I got because I just kept putting them off. You feel like Spider-Man while you're playing this, quips and all, albeit with maybe a bit more tech than I usually would expect out of him. You can unlock suits from many different iterations of Spider-Man and I loved swapping between them to try out their unique abilities. The game is also quite good looking and I found myself taking lots of pretty screenshots in different areas of the city or in combat. In total it took me just shy of 54 hours to 100% the game. I fully recommend this game at full price or on sale as I think it's got more than enough content to be worth it.",

Villains in particular.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I did not like was when I have to do some missions with MJ or Miles but fortunately they are scarce, not long and pretty simple.\r\nIt's just a downgrade from playing the amazing Spiderman and the story bits it brings are not very amusing.\r\n\r\nThe only one that is actually interesting is a latter mission with MJ where we must coordinate with Spiderman to round up some bad guys, but aside from that particular mission we are always alone with that side caracter doing basic human stuff and it's kind of meh.\r\nBut like I said, they are only 4 or 5 missions like this, in a world of Spiderman ones.",

        "review": "Spider-Man Remastered really takes an already amazing game and just makes it so much better. Visual improvements in this are stunning, and swinging through New York feels smoother than ever. Even the faster load times and updated character models give it a different feel, but it still retains all the fun of the original. It still retains a story that is just as gripping, and the combat is super fluid, satisfying. Honestly, a replay or jumping in for the first time, it is one of the best superhero games out there.\r\n\r\nJust incredible visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times take an already great game in Spider-Man Remastered and elevate the experience to a whole new level. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace. For those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment. However, if you're satisfied with the original, the remaster might not offer enough to warrant a second purchase.\r\n\r\nSpider-Man Remastered doesn't just look great\u2014it tells a fantastic story too. It goes really in-depth into Peter Parker's life, with the juggling of responsibilities as both a superhuman and an everyday man. You get to see him juggle his relationships, face certain choices of action, and go up against iconic villains such as Doctor Octopus, Rhino, and the Vulture. The way the game tackles storytelling is just so legitimate and emotional; Peter's struggles have made him super relatable. Plus, its character development is pretty spot on, mainly the building up of his relationship with characters like MJ and Aunt May. The story mixed with the amazing gameplay really makes it an immersive experience. For sure, the mechanics within Spider-Man Remastered make it really great.\r\n\r\nSwinging through New York is slick, instinctive practice that manages to capture a very real sense of freedom as you sweep between skyscrapers. The combat flows well, with the correct dose of web-slinging, acrobatics, and gadgets that will make combat with enemies quite varied and entertaining. There is a feel that you can pull off awesome combos and dodge attacks with Spidey agility deftly, using the environment against foes. The stealth aspect in the game is equally well-implemented, where the player can sneak around and silently take out enemies where required. Whether you\u2019re in a high-speed chase or taking on a group of thugs, the controls are responsive, making the action feel satisfying every time. While Spider-Man Remastered is an amazing game, it does have a few minor flaws. It's wonderfully designed, but sometimes the open world feels a little same-ish.\r\n\r\nSide missions and random street crimes tend to be very similar, and oftentimes will feel somewhat like filler after a while. A few of these puzzle and stealth sections-especially ones where you switch to playing as MJ or Miles-can suck the air out of what would otherwise be pulsating with high-energy action. Whether or not the Spider-Man Remastered version is worth purchasing really depends on how much you value the visual upgrades and next-generation performance improvements if you already own the original Spider-Man game. The remastered version looks absolutely beautiful, and with quicker loading and an altogether smoother experience, it really gives the game polish. Still, the underlying story and gameplay remain the same. If you\u2019re a huge fan of the game and want to see it in its best possible form, the remaster is worth the investment. But if you\u2019re content with the original and aren\u2019t too concerned about the graphical improvements, it might not be a must-buy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered elevates an already fantastic game with stunning visual improvements, smoother mechanics, and faster load times, making the experience even more enjoyable. The story remains compelling and emotionally engaging, while the combat and traversal mechanics continue to shine, offering a fluid and dynamic gameplay experience. However, the open world can feel a bit repetitive at times, and some stealth and puzzle sections may slow down the pace.\r\n\r\nFor those who haven't played the original, the remastered version is a must-play, delivering one of the best superhero games available. If you already own the original, it comes down to how much you value the enhanced graphics and next-gen performance. If you're eager for the best possible version of the game, it's worth the investment.

The game flows well, the combat is smooth and engaging. and the characters are easy to invest in. You can unlock all kinds of spider suits that are new to the franchise and legacy outfits from the comics and television adaptations. This game has some of the best fan service you can ask for as a marvel fan. \r\n\r\nOnly one real gripe I have with this game is the Mary Jane and Miles missions. They aren't bad by any stretch just boring compared to the normal gameplay. One minute you're zipping across sky scrapers and the next you're forced into a stealth section as a normie. There are mods on Nexus that allow you to skip these missions that are fairly easy to install with a mod manager. \r\n\r\nIn summation, if you're a fan of Spider-Man or just Marvel in general, you will probably enjoy this game a lot. If you're the person that doesn't care for Marvel but you do enjoy stealth, movement mechanics and beat em up style games you will also probably enjoy this.... If you are J. Jonah Jameson you will HATE this game",

[/b]\nMy favourite out of the 3 DLC's was [b] Silver Lining.

[/b] (4)\nThere are a lot of miscellaneous items to collect from the backpacks too.\n\n\n[h3] Swinging: [/h3]\nOne of my favourite parts of this game is the swinging.\nIt's very fun when you're going fast, especially with all the skill upgrades.\nHowever, the tricks are very basic compared to [b] Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. [/b]\n\n\n[h3] Combat: [/h3]\nThe combat is really satisfying. in my opinion, more than [b] Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

I think my recommend is to go safe with the console version since that would be better optimized against crashes. Outside of that overall main game story is ok but the gameplay is amazing.",

The movement is amazing, and the combat offers multiple ways to fight, whether it\u2019s being stealthy, just punching the heck out of the bad guys, or webbing them up with the tons of different gadgets. The story is pretty good, too, and I\u2019m excited to see where it ends up. I\u2019m going to buy Miles Morales once I finish this, and I\u2019m excited for the second one to come out on PC!",
